President Rouhani scathingly calls US President Donald Trump a "serious threat to regional and world security" and offers perks to SCO companies investing in his country. The man is right, but Mr. Trump is here representative of the entire terrorist organization NATO!

While the war dogs are pulling on their chains, something extraordinary happened at the 19th summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at the end of the week in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.

Virtually unknown in the West, the SCO is the most important political, economic and security alliance in Eurasia. It is not a Eurasian NATO. It does not plan humanitarian imperialist adventures. A single picture from Bishkek tells a meaningful story.

These leaders represent the currently eight members of the SCO. Then there are the four observer States, Afghanistan, Belarus, Mongolia, Iran and six dialogue partners: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey.

The SCO will extend up to 2020, both Turkey and Iran received may be the full membership, so that the SCO would then unite all the major players in the Eurasian Integration. Looking at the current weather on the geopolitical chessboard, it can hardly have been a coincidence that a weighty Protagonist in Bishkek was the "observer"state of Iran.

#### Iran as a Partner in the SCO

Iranian President Rouhani played his cards masterfully. When Rouhani speaks directly to Putin, Modi, Xi and Imran at a table, it is very serious to take. He referred to the US Trump as a "serious risk to stability in the Region and worldwide". Then he offered discounted conditions to all companies and entrepreneurs of SCO member states who undertook to invest in the Iranian market.

The Trump Administration has claimed, without evidence, that the Islamic revolutionary guard behind the attacks on the two tankers in the Gulf of Oman in the week from 13. June is. But such a thing is not unknown to Russia either. 

During the SCO summit this Narrative collapsed already, as Yutaka Katada, President of the Japanese freight company Kokuka Sangyo and the owner of the Tanker, said:

> The Crew says the ship was hit by a flying object.

Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif had accused the White House of operating" Sabotage diplomacy", but this did not let the diplomacy of Rouhani in Bishkek derail.

Beijing will continue to work on relations with Iran, "regardless of how the situation might change". Iran is a major hub on the new Silk Road. The leadership in Tehran is aware that a perfect Integration in the vast, Eurasia-wide economic Ecosystem is the only way forward. European Nations that have signed the nuclear agreement with Tehran can not save Iran economically.

#### What is India's path?

However, in the short term, Modi called for bilateral talks with Rouhani and apologized for the lame excuse of "scheduling problems".

This was not exactly a clever diplomatic move. Before the Trump Administration left the JPCOA nuclear agreement just over a year ago, India was Iran's second-largest oil customer. Modi and Rouhani have considered the possibility that India will pay the Iranian oil in rupees, thereby bypassing the US Dollar and the US sanctions.

However, unlike Beijing and Moscow, New Delhi refuses to support Tehran in his struggle for life and death against the US economic war and the De Facto Blockade.

Modes face an existential choice. He is tempted to serve his instinctive stance against the Belt-and-Road Initiative to the siren cry of a vague US-United [Indo-Pacific Alliance](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/1863396/dod-releases-indo-pacific-strategy-report/source/GovDelivery/fbclid/IwAR0qQXm4Oe5xwDF-vIwIjIx2_8YCUw1IwqVJiaalGjbYFjsds0NHr9sX1X4/ "DOD Releases Indo-Pacific Strategy Report") — de facto a mechanism against "China, China, China", as the Pentagon's leadership openly admits. India just wants to be a Lakai instead of working with neighbors.

However, he could also become more involved in a SCO/RIC (Russia-India-China) Alliance, which focuses on Eurasian Integration and multipolarity.

The stakes are high, which is why a joint charm Offensive of the BRICS-and SCO - duo is being launched. Putin invited Modi for early September as the main guest to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. In addition, Xi Jinping Modi made it known in a bilateral conversation that he was aiming for a "closer partnership", starting with Investment and industrial capacity, to a boost to the Bangladesh - China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor, another BRI supporter.

#### Pakistan as a hub of Eurasia

Imran Khan, on the other hand, seems to be well aware of how Pakistan could benefit from being the perfect hub of Eurasia - Islamabad offers a privileged access to the Arab sea alongside the SCO observer Iran. The port of Gwadar is the main hub of the Chinese-Pakistani Economic Corridor, but it is much better positioned than the Iranian port of Chabahar, which is being expanded just as an important hub of India's small "New Silk Road"Version towards Afghanistan and Central Asia.

On the Russian Front, the Charme Offensive against Pakistan is already worthwhile, Imran publicly confirmed that Pakistan "approaches" Russia in a "changing"world. He also expressed strong interest in acquiring Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and Mi-35M assault helicopters.

Iran is at the heart of the BRI-SCO-EAEU integration strategy. the A and O of Eurasian Integration. Russia and China believe that Iran will not cut off the air, Iran has enormous energy reserves, has a huge domestic market and is at the forefront of the fight against a complex smuggling networks for Opium, weapons, and jihadists. All these are central concerns of SCO member states.

#### Conflicts of interest between Russia and Iran

There is no doubt that the interests of Russia and Iran in South-West Asia collide. The main concern of Moscow, to prevent the jihadists in the Caucasus and Central Asia, to plan there attacks against the Russian Federation, to keep the naval and air bases in Syria and the oil - and-gas trade undisturbed to maintain.

Tehran cannot under any circumstances support the kind of secret agreements that have been agreed by Moscow with Tel Aviv for Syria — where Hezbollah and IRCG are allegedly attacked by Israel with bombs, but never Russian installations.

However, there is room for negotiation for bilateral diplomacy, although it does not seem to be very large. The Supreme leader, Khamenei has the new [game rules](https://ejmagnier.com/2019/06/13/irans-leader-of-the-revolution-recommends-four-steps-for-confronting-the-us/ "IRAN’S LEADER OF THE REVOLUTION RECOMMENDS FOUR STEPS FOR CONFRONTING THE US") placed finally all agree that we have to stick together in the face of a deadly threat, and continue to assume that Iran has no reliable friends, not even China and Russia.

Iran is in a state of siege. An internal regulation must be a top priority. This does not preclude, however, a rejection of the efforts to Eurasian Integration.

Pan-Eurasian integration became even more apparent immediately after the events in Bishkek, at the summit of the conference on interaction and confidence-building measures in Asia ([CICA](https://tass.com/economy/1063957 "Russia calls for abandoning global trade wars - Putin")) in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.

#### Association of Eurasian Economic organisations

Bishkek and Dushanbe expanded what was already widely discussed at the St. Petersburg Forum. Putin himself stressed that all of the vectors, BRI (Belt and Road Initiative, New silk road), EAEU (Eurasian economic Union), SCO (Shanghai cooperation organization), CICA (conference for interaction and confidence-building measures in Asia) and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), should be integrated.

The Declaration of Bishkek, which was adopted by all SCO members, as a document may not grab the headlines, but stressed that the security guarantees of the Central Asian agreement on nuclear-weapon-free Zone, as well as "the Unacceptability of efforts to ensure the security of one country at the expense of the safety of another country," and condemned the "unilateral and unlimited buildup of missile defense systems by certain countries and groups of countries".

And yet the declaration is a true product of a quest for a multilateral, multipolar world.

Among the 21 agreements signed by the SCO, there is also a strategic plan for the key SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group. This was stressed by the commandment of the strategic partners Russia and China that Eurasian powers should make the decision on the Afghanistan Drama.

What Putin, Xi and Modi have discussed in Detail and behind closed doors in Bishkek will be further developed at their Mini-BRICS meeting, the RIC (Russia-India-China), at the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka at the end of June.

Meanwhile, the US industrial, military and security complex will continue to be possessed by Russia as a "revitalized vicious actor" - in addition to the all - encompassing "threat" by China.

The U.S. Navy is obsessed with the asymmetric Know-How "of our Russian, Chinese and Iranian rivals" in the "disputed waterways" from the South China sea to the Persian Gulf.

While the US conservatives are building "maximum pressure" to take the supposedly weak gear in the Eurasian Integration into the pliers, which is already in a total economic war because it bypasses, among other things, the US Dollar, no one can predict what the chessboard will look like when the SCO and BRICS summits in 2020 will take place in Russia.
