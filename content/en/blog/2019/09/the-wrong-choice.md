The EU elections, not the European elections as they are trying to strike back in their heads, have once again made it clear to voters that their elections did not actually have any influence on who received what office or what policies are being pursued. The primacy of politics. The rule of the parties.

> Looking back at the history of the Federal Republic, we can say that all the major decisions had no demoscopic majority when they were made. ([Angela Merkel](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/service/bulletin/rede-von-bundeskanzlerin-dr-angela-merkel-794788 "Rede von Bundeskanzlerin Dr. Angela Merkel"))

"And that should also be held". It also indirectly explains how it is possible for politicians to take decisions against the majority opinion of the Germans without the latter going to the barricades. "Only in hindsight has the attitude of the Germans changed in many cases". It indirectly explains why the parties were able to retain their power, because this change of opinion in some cases is due to the media. These ensure that there is no doubt about the legitimacy of the system.

But the EU elections have also shown what the political Establishment and the circles that benefit from it are afraid of: the delegation of too low voter turnout. And so before the last EU election, not only did the parties conduct an unusual advertising campaign to this extent, but all the forces of the establishment, such as the industry associations. An attempt was made to implement the following false narratives into the heads of the recipients of the messages:

  1. The EU was referred to as "Europe", although it comprises less than half of the land mass of Europe.

  2. the EU would be a "peace project", although it was and is involved in the Kosovo war of aggression from 24 March 1999 to 9 June 1999 on the part of the UCK Serbia. 

  3.the EU would make it possible to travel freely within "Europe", although, of course, a free journey was possible even before the abolition of border controls, only that one had to present his passport.

  4. The EU would be necessary in order that the voice of the European countries (with the EU-countries) in the world has a weight, and, although the EU has, in principle, the NATO, and, in its Association agreements, a "harmonisation" of the security policy requires, such of what NATO intended. And, as can be seen in all US sanctions, the EU plays a role in the world only as a vassal of the US, but not as an independent political force.

And, of course, the same threats and warnings were used as in all elections:

Who does not choose, the Chooses right. It is possible to choose small parties that oppose the consensus of the "state-supporting" parties. You have to choose to prevent the worst. You have to choose the lesser evil. In other countries, people die to vote.

#### Reasons for non-select and its objectives

Voters feel less and less represented by their" representatives of the people". And the larger the political units become, the more detached the politicians appear. And of course, people have not missed the fact that politics has become independent and the so-called Sovereign has been reduced to make once every few years his cross at one of the parties, which are supported by the media as sufficiently qualified for a cross. However, whether and which policies were followed after that, the voters have no influence whatsoever.

Neither can he directly elect the government, nor can he somehow participate in important issues. Even a decision as important as war or peace is not granted to him. It cannot be co-ordinated when the election of the federal president is due, or when the Supreme judges, the Guardians of the Constitution, are appointed by the ranks of the parties. Speaking Of The Constitution. Of course, he was never allowed to vote on a constitution or its amendments. This is a fact that is taken for granted in the alleged "Mullah dictatorship” in Iran.

And from these clear deficits, which show that it is not a democracy in Germany, the objectives of the "delegates" result by not voting:

  1. To be heard, more direct democracy, the realization of a separation of powers at the very beginning. The Council of Europe and the Supreme Court of the EU confirmed that the [German justice](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=214466&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=5818768 "The institutional independence of the judiciary in Germany - a result of the deficit") is not independent. Details of the former judge Udo Hochschild has described in his Blog www.gewaltenteilung.de . It is intolerable that parties decide on the appointment of judges, their decisions, even worse is that these judges are former politicians. Equally unacceptable is the fact that prosecutors are appointed by politicians and then have to follow their instructions. Similarly, financial dependence should be put to an end by providing the judiciary with its own Budget.
  
  2. The parties have not fulfilled the promise in the basic law, that Germany must give to the reunification of a Constitution. This promise must finally be fulfilled. Constitutional changes must be confirmed by referendums in principle.
  
  3. Democracy can only work if the Basis of the voters ' choices is as neutral as possible. The public-law media are not neutral, but understand themselves as educational media in the sense of the ruling parties. The management of public media must finally be organised in such a way that these media can exercise a control function. This means that they must not be controlled by the parties in the Bundestag, but must be responsible to the media consumers and themselves control the parties, in particular the governing parties. The parties must be subjected to critical media scrutiny, not vice versa, and these media must commit themselves to pluralistic and fair reporting.
  
  4. And finally, elements of direct democracy need to make sure that it is not representative, but rather the people decide for themselves about fundamental aspects of your life. International treaties, in particular those which restrict the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany. How can representatives decide what degree of sovereignty those they represent should have? These include questions about war or peace, fundamental changes in Budget Policy, for example doubling of arms expenditure, taxation and social policy.

#### The end of "divide and conquer”

These four demands should be completely independent of ideology, political attitude or belief from all people who feel obliged to a truly democratic basic order.

This movement could for the first time break the framework of political influence alone by parties.

A new party will always be placed in a political corner at some point, and will then be avoided by all who cannot make a friend with this political direction. The demands for the return of sovereignty from the parties to the voters are, however, a universal demand that can and should be shared by people of all democratic political directions. Except, of course, those who benefit directly from the system of party consensus. And so the" system-supporting "Left parties will defame the proposal as "right” and right parties as"left-wing".

#### Parliamentary elections

On 1 September, state elections were held in Brandenburg and Saxony. Many voters in these countries again believe they can change something by voting. In both countries, surveys foresee a significant increase in votes for the AfD. Many voters believe that the election of the AfD will enable the federal government to change its policy.

Others, in turn, believe that it is now essential to give their voice to the established parties in order to stop the "jerk to the right". And even if you are dissatisfied with politics, you think you have to choose the "lesser evil".

After the election, both groups will find soberly that their expectations have not been met, but the media will explain to them that this is all right. And at the next election again drums with the same arguments, so that people go to the election.

#### Why is there no Quorum for parliamentary and parliamentary elections?

In 2014, the turnout in Brandenburg and Saxony was less than 50 percent at the last election. In Bavaria, a Quorum of 10 percent of the electorate is regarded as a prerequisite that a popular petition is considered "valid". In Saxony, the Quorum is 25 percent of the electorate, who must agree to the popular petition. In the Bundestag and the Landtag, there are also quorums for voting on laws. In other words, the number of members who must have cast their vote in order for the election to be considered valid will be determined.

"Participation quorums can be found in the rules of procedure of all German parliaments (Bundestag and Länder parliaments) as well as in the statutes of many associations. The parliaments often have a Quorum of 50 per cent".

How is it that no Quorum has been established which legitimises the election of a land or federal parliament?

This discussion could come into being if the voters in Saxony and Brandenburg consider themselves simply not to vote this time, instead of once again" the lesser evil "or the" We will definitely do better " to vote. Imagine that any voter who is dissatisfied with the System of this "parliamentary democracy" because he sees no real influence on politics would remain at home and not vote. And voter turnout would fall below 40 percent, and all parties would miss their goals far. Could an "electoral winner"be determined at all? Would the parties then not be forced to step back into a discussion of more direct democracy and giving part of their power back to the voters?

#### Conclusion

Just now it became known how the federal government had responded to the question of whether it would now end its support for the British capture of the tanker with the Iranian oil. Finally, the lack of international law, incidentally for the third time within 11 months, was confirmed by the scientific service of the German Bundestag. The answer was that the scientific opinion would not be relevant.

By abstaining from voting this political System showing the red card is perhaps the last Chance to get it back to the" German people " its sovereignty. In any case, as far as sovereignty still exists in view of the numerous assignments of sovereignty to multinational organisations such as the EU and NATO. If the parties are not prepared to do so, there is a danger of an ever-increasing emigration of voters to the camps of the extremists.

We should not forget why parliaments and elections were once created. They should allow for a takeover of power without bloodshed in the event of changes in social conditions. However, this has become impossible due to the cartel of the "state-supporting" parties and the primacy of politics (see above Angela Merkel).

Anyone who wants to prevent extremism, Frustration, hatred and emigration to obscure leaders must be prepared to approve Germany's voters for democracy.
