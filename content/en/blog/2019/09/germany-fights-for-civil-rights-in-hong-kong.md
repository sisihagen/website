It was the hallowed hour of ARD: The "Tagesthemen", a branch of the "Tagesschau", gave the Hong Kong civil rights activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung a nice, long interview. Hours earlier, the editorial board had already worked on this news and reported on the "clear words" of the chancellor that Mrs Merkel had found for the Hong Kong activists during her visit to China.

Yes, when the leading woman and the leading public media present, then the media remnant must provide its echo: from SPIEGEL to DIE WELT, the weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT to the website of the city of Paderborn: everyone found democracy in China quite inadequate and the Lord Wong really good. This is what media diversity looks like in Germany. Isn't that interference in a state that you always say to others? 

#### It is a recognizable pattern

Evil always takes place somewhere else. Preferably in those foreigners who feel like competitors or who urgently need to buy new expensive weapons. For as evil as the Russian is, for example, he could attack us at any time. There are also fond reports of the terrible repression of that opposition to despots, which the US or NATO troops then took care of on occasion.

But it is also about the pleasant feeling of German media consumers: elsewhere it is already bad, how good that it is much better with us. For a year now, the same coalition has ruled, which has been the government since the end of the war. For a long time, gentrified in the "good locations" of German cities, rents are increased and increased .. until it crunches. Sometimes there is a rent brake, then again about a cap on rents. Was there an interview at best airtime with an activist for the expropriation of large housing companies? Oh where. – Apparently, the Grand Coalition is sleeping in this way.

What about the passage in the coalition agreement that established the tightening of the guidelines for arms exports? There is a bright awake in the chancellery: it does not come to the table of the government. There was the young, intelligent [Clara Tempel](https://www.stripes.com/news/at-germany-s-last-nuclear-base-fears-of-a-new-arms-race-as-us-russia-treaty-collapses-1.571230 "At Germany's last nuclear base, fears of a new arms race as US-Russia treaty collapses"), who had to go to prison for a week because she had blocked an Air Force runway at büchel nuclear weapons base in September 2016.

Public-law perception? Null. But in a private media corner, the "Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung" (HAZ), there was something short and painless. The HAZ somehow belongs to the Madsack media group, and it also belongs a little to the SPD. But the SPD has, of course, long since been privatised by Gerhard Schroeder.

#### Where privately it says, of course, a lot of money is earned.

The widow of publisher Axel Springer is at the forefront of the media money earners. It has 4.8 billion euros in 2019 and a mixed newspaper-transmitter empire. In second and third place are also two women: businesswoman Yvonne Bauer and her family, owner of Bauer Media Group (e.g. Bravo), with 3.5 billion euros and the family around Liz Mohn with 3.35 billion euros, shareholder of the Gütersloher media monster Bertelsmann (RTL, Gruner + Year).

The revenues of public broadcasters from advertising and sponsorship are also generated in a highly private way. For ARD, this a43.9 million euros, while ZDF generated 293.6 million euros. Of course, the advertising agencies place their TV spots in the context of high ratings. They are often achieved with sports broadcasts or other simple broadcasts. In this way, the economy has a direct impact on the programme.

This is, of course, nothing against the revenues of EUR 7.858 billion from the recovery of the broadcasting contribution. The confiscated by law is ensured by those politicians who, on the one hand, like to squat in the broadcasting councils, the supervisory bodies, and on the other hand, are often connected to the economy through a network of open party donations and unofficial lobbying. This is how indirect influence works.

#### What is left for the democracy activists in Germany?

What is nice for them if they want to be perceived in the country? They should move their activities abroad. The further away, the sooner their goals are likely to be reflected in the German media and supported by German politicians. Shouldn't the Stuttgart 21 opponents have demonstrated better in Shanghai? The blockade of a runway at Kaliningrad-Chrabrowo airport would certainly have a strong public response in Germany. Someone should have given Clara Tempel a tip in time.

However, protests against the further expansion of the Transrapid in Shanghai are not recommended: the Federal Government and the entrepreneur Thyssenkrupp AG were involved in the magnetic express way. The actual protests against the route of the Transrapid in China then hardly had an echo in Germany.
