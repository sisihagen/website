"Stop the wars" said the title of today's event on the eve of May 1.  The announcement already enumerates the main countries represented by wars and indirect interventions involving the West. "Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Mali. One could probably also add Somalia, Ivory Coast, Sudan and Congo.

Since then, after the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, NATO is no longer faced with equivalent opponents, we have had to look at how more and more countries have been targeted by the United States and its allies or how their policies have fueled conflicts even further.

With these wars and conflicts, the number of refugees in the world also increased dramatically. While 38 million refugees and internally displaced persons had already been registered at the turn of the millennium, the number has since [increased](https://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends2017/ "TRENDS AT A GLANCE") by 30 million to 68.5 million almost a third comes from the above-mentioned countries.

Currently, the war in Yemen has the most terrible effects on the population, dramatically exacerbated by the Saudi Arabia imposed a murderous Blockade against the country. The US provides direct support for the attacking States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Germany also supports the aggressor in this war, primarily politically, but also militarily, primarily through the supply of weapons and other military equipment. The supply to the Saudis was temporarily stopped in October 2018, but not because of the war. Continue to the UAE. In addition, Germany, like the other EU countries, de facto accepts the Saudi hunger blockade.

Germany is even more involved in Syria. On the one hand, since 2011 Berlin has been working together with other NATO states and the allied Gulf monarchs on a Regime Change by organising or providing political and logistical support for so-called "insurgents". Since 2014, the Bundeswehr has also been in operation and is involved in the bombardments of the US-led alliance against the so-called "Islamic State".

On the other hand, we are also affected by the events of war here, because in the course of the war hundreds of thousands of Syrians came to Germany as refugees.

"We are here because you are destroying our countries" was the title of a conference of the group "[Lampedusa in Hamburg](http://www.ag-friedensforschung.de/themen/Migration1/hh.html "'Wir sind hier, weil ihr unsere Länder zerstört': Aussagen einer Konferenz der Gruppe 'Lampedusa in Hamburg'")", whereby "her" meant the EU countries. It was a group of about 300 men, who fled before the NATO war against Libya and the Italian Lampedusa to Europe. At that time, 2013 and 2014, they achieved a certain degree of national attention with public awareness campaigns for a collective right to remain for the entire group.

"We are here because you destroy our countries" can also say the arrival of refugees from Syria.

Meanwhile, it is quite well documented that the US and the EU states are largely responsible for the war in and against Syria. Without their "Regime Change" policy, their massive, diverse interventions, the protests in Syria, which started in March 2011, would not be turned into an armed uprising in a few weeks and certainly not into a real war. A war that devastated large parts of the country, entire cities, and cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

Without the war and occupation in Iraq, and without the massive arming of Islamist militias, without the influx of fighters from all over the world, would not be Al Nusra Front and similar terrorist gangs become large. In particular, no "Islamic State" could have spread to such an extent that the NATO states could feel called to fight it with their air forces and thereby put Iraqi and Syrian major cities in ruins.

I don't want to go any further. This is well documented in a brochure of [IPPNW](http://www.ippnw.de/frieden/konflikte-kriege/artikel/de/der-syrienkrieg-dimension-hint.html "Der Syrienkrieg: Dimension – Hintergründe – Perspektiven") which was very carefully compiled and discussed extensively within the organization: the Syrian war: Dimension – backgrounds – perspectives, Dec. 2018.

The war in and against Syria, which has now lasted for more than seven years, and which has been fuelled externally, was not a civil war in the classical sense from the outset. Also "deputy War" describes the conflict, which gradually expanded to a "small world war" with entangled alliances and confusing fronts between numerous military actors, not enough. Fight in him in different ways and strength on the one hand, the three Western permanent UN security Council members, a number of other NATO States, especially Turkey, Israel and the Arab monarchies of the Gulf, and on the other Russia and Iran ‒ the latter the war not have started, however, handles Essentially defensive military until much later than the NATO countries.

Of course, all the warring parties were involved in the various destructions in this country, but only the Syrian and Russian forces are denounced and the tremendous devastation caused by the air war of the US-led alliance over Syria and Iraq simply hidden.

However, regardless of how one assesses the actions of the various warring parties: as with any war, the main responsibility for the horrors he usually brings with him, those who have unleashed him and who subsequently prevent his cessation, inter alia, in which they torpedoed peace negotiations through preconditions, such as the prior withdrawal of the Syrian government.

#### Current Situation

Syria has disappeared from the headlines, you might think the war was over.

In fact, the Syrian army, with the support of its allies, has managed to regain control of most of the country. Many fighters have adopted the amnesty regulations and handed down their weapons. However, the country is still far from peace and the conflict situation is still complex and opaque.

The Idlib province, in which all the fighters who did not want to give up in the wake of the recapture, are controlled by jihadist, Al-Qaeda-related groups, which from there also repeatedly launch attacks. From the perspective of Damascus, but also of the population an unsustainable state. Plans for military recapture are on hold for the time being. Russia is still trying to persuade Turkey to cease its support for the militias there and to persuade their allies to do so. The prospects are bad.

North of it is the mostly Kurdish province of Afrin, which was invaded and occupied last spring by Turkish troops and Islamist militias. It has since served as a corridor for the groups of Al Qaeda in Idlib as [Passage](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/30/syria-chemical-attack-war-intervention-oil-gas-energy-pipelines "Syria intervention plan fueled by oil interests, not chemical weapon concern") to get from there to Turkey.

Turkey has no intention of withdrawing from Africa and other occupied territories of northern Syria. On The Contrary. It also wants to occupy a 30-kilometre-wide so-called buffer zone from the Euphrates to northern Iraq. The Erdogan Regime wants to keep the leading forces of the Syrian Kurds, who call it a "terrorist organization", at a distance.

The United States with the assistance of the Syrian-Kurdish fighting groups, a part of Syria East of the Euphrates occupied in the course of Advancing against the IS have captured, in part, in a race against the Syrian army. This removes areas that are enormously important for the country's supply, from the access of the Syrian government and thus also the population of the rest of the country, at least 70 percent of Syria. Here are the oil and gas springs, the largest water reserves, most wheat is cultivated. The supply problems arising from this are obviously deliberate.

The aim of the US is to split up Syria and to remove as large a territory as possible from the control of the Syrian government. An expansion of the Turkish occupation of northern Syria by the targeted buffer zone would certainly counter these plans. However, the Turks would have to tolerate their Kurdish allies. However, this is not acceptable to Ankara.

Washington is now urging the Kurds to meet him and to allow a limited number of Turkish soldiers on Syrian territory along the border, supplemented by troops from European Nato states.

In December, Trump announced aloud that he would immediately have the US troops removed. Officially, it is about 2000 soldiers, special forces ,but [presumably](https://www.moonofalabama.org/2019/02/syria-sitrep-us-says-it-will-retreat-but-adds-troops-arms-and-ammunition.html "Syria Sitrep - Trump Says U.S. Will Leave But Pentagon Keeps Adding Forces")  it is much more. However, he came across massive resistance from both parties in Washington and also from the European capitals. He eventually had to stretch out his time data. Now you can bet what sooner comes the withdrawal or the Brexit.

Meanwhile, the Trump Administration is trying to get its allies more into the boat. France has already deployed several hundred special forces east of the Euphrates. As residents of the area report, soldiers from other Nato states as well as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia also join. German soldiers are also supposed to have been seen, but this is denied by Berlin.

Most other NATO countries are also covered. This could be related to the fact that everything they do in Syria ‒ from the air war to the occupation of Syrian territory-is a blatant violation of the country's sovereignty, a clear violation of international law, basically, a war Act, a military Invasion.

The US and its allies have failed for the time being with their real aim, the overthrow of Assad and the Installation of a pro-Western regime. However, they are making every effort to ensure that in Damascus and Moscow there is no joy of success.

However, the division of the country, as agreed at the beginning of last year within the framework of the so-called "small Syrian group", is intended to prevent stabilisation of the country and reconstruction for the time being and continue to bind forces of Russia. A protocol of talks by this group, which in addition to the United States of America, France, Saudi Arabia and Jordan now also belongs to Germany, got into the public eye.

Considering the occupied territories as a bargaining chip in negotiations with them at the end using other means, such as Blockade, Sabotage and blackmail, but still far-reaching concessions can be achieved.

The persistence of destabilising the country and its cleavage is also due to the fact that it is not only about Syria, but also about supremacy in the region as a whole, strategically and economically important.

As always, intervention in Syria was, of course, justified by its commitment to democracy and Human Rights. In fact, it was directed mainly against Iran, which had risen to the strongest regional power by the destruction of Iraq, and also against Russia. The war in and against Syria must therefore be seen in the wider context, also in connection with the intensification of the US embargo against Iran and, in some respects, the war against Yemen.

If we want to stop the wars, we have to clarify their background. Human rights are of course an issue that we take very seriously. However, it is not the best in most countries of the world. We have to stop looking good at those targeting the West. The European Union must take action in this area. Just a look at the despots with whom we move in perfect harmony against countries such as Syria or Libya in the field, should be reason enough to distrust the humanitarian pretexts. In addition to civil rights, we should also be much more concerned with social rights. It is no accident that, in this respect, it looks better in most of the countries targeted than in their neighbouring countries.

Wars can be fought because not only the true interests are hidden, but also the devastating consequences.

We must demand accountability from those responsible in Berlin, Washington, London and Paris for what they have done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, including through the devastating action against the castles of the Islamic State, such as Mosul and Raqqa.

#### Solidarity

Let us come to solidarity with the people affected in the war zones

Syria was able to regain control of most of the country with the help of its allies. But the price is very high. Whole towns and city districts, as well as the civilian infrastructure in ruins, fields lie fallow. In 2010, Syria's economy boomed, and now it is on the ground.

Syria is unable to rebuild the country on its own. The estimates of the cost of up to 400 billion dollars.

If our government and those of the other EU countries were indeed about the people of Syria, as they say, they would now have to help them rebuild their country in the liberated areas and thus enable the refugees to return.

Nothing like this happens ‒ on the contrary. Germany belongs to the countries that provide the most generous funding for Syria, only in areas that are not under the control of Damascus, i.e., in the Idlib province, where jihadists dominate, and in the Kurds and US troops-controlled area in the North-East.

Considerable resources are also being made available for the provision of refugees in the camps. This is of course still necessary. But most want to go home as soon as possible. Aid organizations therefore point out that the Syrians would be helped more sustainably if instead of just distributing bread, water, medicines, etc., the Syrians would be able to repair bakeries, repair the electricity and water supply and rebuild their once excellent food and pharmaceutical industries.

If Germany were to give the bulk of the funds earmarked for such aid to Syria, it would be, according to a boarding school. Helpers who have a Win-Win Situation for everyone. Germany would be relieved, refugees could return and help with reconstruction.

However, the federal government and the EU continue to strictly refuse to allocate funds to Syria as long as Assad still governs.

#### Murderous Sanctions

They even worsen the Situation massively by holding firm to the unilateral economic sanctions that they, like the US, have imposed since 2011 and have intensified ever more. Where "sanctions" is not the right term. Although, as always, they are justified by human rights violations, the US and the EU are not legitimised by anything to impose sanctions.

Regardless of such trade and financial blockades always in the first line of the population. They are ultimately another form of war.

According to a report by the UN organization for economic and social affairs in western Asia (ESCWA), sanctions against Syria are the most severe and far-reaching sanctions ever imposed on a country.

The UN Special Rapporteur" on the negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on human rights", the UN Diplomat Idriss Jazairy, in any case, was dismayed by the consequences of the embargo measures. In this way, even humanitarian organisations are partly making the aid impossible. The consequences of the war were devastating, but the sanctions made the Situation worse, said Jazairy. Each of the Syrians was affected.

The trade and financial blockades work, as the special rapporteur of the UN Human Rights Council for Latin America, Alfred De Zayas, stated in his report on comparable coercive measures against Venezuela, such as the siege of medieval towns, where the resulting shortage, misery, the increase in disease and death should lead to a abandonment of power or a revolt. Turning a country's people into hostages is a crime.

However, the sanctions of the 21st century are trying to bring down not only a city, but sovereign countries, according to De Zayas. In contrast to the Middle Ages, the blockades of the 21st century would be accompanied by the Manipulation of public opinion by 'Fake News', an aggressive PR work and a Pseudo-human rights rhetoric ... to give the impression that the 'goal' of human rights justifies criminal means. 

About how many Syrians he was victims of no estimates.

With regard to the Embargo against Iraq, which was maintained for 13 years, from 1990 to the renewed war in 2003, the estimates range from one to 1.5 million, 500,000 of them children.

Nevertheless, it is now a warfare that is commonplace and hardly questioned by politics and the media.

The embargo measures imposed by the US and EU states via Venezuela, which also aim at a Regime Change, have demanded estimates by the Washington Research Institute Centre for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) since 2015 already 40,000 lives.

Alfred De Zayas, in his report on Venezuela, called on the UN to have it investigated by the International Criminal Court as a crime against humanity. The same can certainly be demanded for such comprehensive blockades against other countries such as Syria, Cuba, Iran or North Korea. It is time that we criticize these blockages as what they are, a war by other means. US scientists spoke of mass destruction sanctions in Iraq.

If we want to be in solidarity with the people of Syria, we must, of course, demand, first and foremost, that they should finally be allowed to decide on their own country's policies. We must call for and support peace negotiations, in which, of course, the government in office is sitting at the table.

We need to get from the dt. The government and the EU are calling for sufficient funds for reconstruction, not only as aid but also as restitution.

And we must demand an end to the blockades.

A remarkable example of solidarity was shown by the Eichstätter Bishop Gregor Maria Hanke. He had travelled to Syria in mid-February, he was in Damascus, Homs and Aleppo, among others, and after his return he described his impressions in extensive talks. As a guest, of course, he had limited insight, but he was very impressed by the power and will to survive in the people living there". They would start, organize and build their lives, said the bishop. However, their efforts would be hampered by the Embargo

"This is especially true of the ordinary people on the street, the people who have little to live with. They are detained by the Embargo.

The journey was far less dangerous than he thought in advance. "The liberated areas are now relatively safe. Through his contacts, Bishop Hanke believes that reconciliation in Syria is possible after the many years of the war. "Syria was a very tolerant society in which the various religious groups could deal well with each other. And you have to say, where the country is liberated, because you try to go this way again, both from the Christian side, from the Muslim side, from the Alawite side."

Though spread by ecclesiastical news agencies none of the mainstream media reported about trip of Bishop Hanke. The Interview with him is easy to find on the net. An act of solidarity could be to make every effort to disseminate the interview with him – and to ask politicians in our constituencies why they extend the suffering of the people of Syria with the maintenance of sanctions.

Many of the Left should also reconsider a little: we have to work much more strongly against the causes of flight in general. Solidarity with the people concerned must not only work when they come to us as refugees.
