As times become more uncertain, the need for perspective grows. That's normal. When the livelihoods on the quicksand of change threaten to collapse, the search for secure foundations for shaping the future is intensified. The spiritual life of societies is moving, sometimes in hectic activity. Solutions are in place for life to offer a friendly outlook.

Many seek the solution in the past, gladly borrowing from thinkers and philosophers of bygone times. These recourse to wisdoms of the past quickly become ineffective because they do not provide a solution to the problems of the present. These wisdoms are past wisdoms that have occasional points of contact with our present time, but only points of contact.

The foundations of these societies, from which this thinking originated, were different from the foundations of our present. It is only the exteriors that coincide with the phenomena that concern us in our world today. And these similarities are also like the similarity of sugar and salt. They are only similar as long as they are only viewed superficially and from the outside. With little more intensive examination of sugar and salt, their diversity quickly becomes apparent.

Still others borrow from religions, sects, the beliefs of other cultures such as shamanism, Mayan calendars and the like, which has just the economic cycle of a comet â€“ rapid ascent, brightly shining and all-over-radiating glow, and just as much rapid disappearance in insignificance. These are recourse to the development alsteps of humanity, which have already been overcome in today's society. Just as riding stagecoaches can be a welcome change for weekend leisure activities, but they have become completely unsuitable for everyday use today. Nevertheless, the stagecoach has been an important development step in the history of mankind and must be respected as such, as well as the achievements of fallen cultures.

Most, however, are looking for a foothold in designs for the future. They worry about the world as it should be, should be. They design models about a future, desirable world that is in line with the ideals and values that you think are the right ones. Then we are talking about moneyless societies or Mars settlements. These thinkers are often referred to as visionaries. But their visions usually do not last long and are often quickly replaced by new visions of new visionaries or dissolve in the visionaries' dispute among themselves about which vision is the right or easier to implement.

All these approaches are all together the refusal to engage with the present. The proper analysis of the present is replaced by the creation of counterworlds. Worldviews, taken from the past or the future, are offered as a substitute for the unsatisfactory current world. The present with the powers that work in it is a book of seven seals to them.

But it is precisely the present that is the state where the past wants to become the future. In it, the experiences of the past are transformed into the possibilities of the future. Only here reality takes place, only here is change possible. The past is a past reality, which is why the past can no longer be changed in retrospect. The future is presumed reality, speculation. Only the present is determined by reality, that is, by the sum of the forces that act and determine a situation. That is why only the present is "real" reality, influencing, formable reality.

Of course, it makes sense to think about the development of the world and our lives in their minds. But it makes no sense to think about what the world should be like or what life would be like if it weren't as it is. Nor does it make sense to glorify the conditions as they once were.

It only makes sense to try to see how the world IS today. For in recognizing reality, the "real" reality, not the existing or presumed, lies the answer to how the world must become different in order to offer people the future.

The most difficult part of the exercise is to perceive and recognize reality. For man does not look at the world without prejudice, but through the glasses of his world view. He projects his idea of the world onto the world itself. This is a normal process in the learning process. One compares his idea of the world with the real world. If the two fit together, the image of the world is consistent with the world as it IS. Only, very often, the signals sent back by the world are not taken seriously when they point out that there is a discrepancy between our idea of the world and its real face. How do you deal with it then? One then questions one's own world view and checks one's own ideas or the references to misjudgments are ignored or bent according to the motto: It cannot be what must not be.

According to aristocrat's world view, the earth was a disk, and until Copernicus it was considered the center of the universe around which all other celestial bodies seemed to revolve. And since over the centuries this view of the world seemed to have proved to be correct, doubts were not appropriate. Until recently, the same was true of Greenspan's theory that monetary policy had overcome the crisis-monence of capitalism. Those who doubted these undoubted findings reaped the head-shaking of the experts and the slackening laymen.

But the development of man is advancing and bringing to the collapse what was considered unshakeable. Insights that were to last for eternity soon became questionable, millennial empires disintegrated after only twelve years.

Today, everyone knows that the Earth is not a disk, nor is it the center of the universe, and anyone who doubts it reaps the ridicule that once struck those who claimed it. And Greenspan's message of the salutary effect of monetary policy has also turned out to be what it was, a (self-)deception of reality that could be sustained for some time, until reality itself turns this deception into a Heaps of shards. It couldn't be what wasn't allowed to be.

Reality is not the same as truth, but truth wants to become a reality. In the iraq war, under Gorge W. Bush, the forces that worked toward war using half-truths and lies had prevailed in the world. In this situation, lies and deception were reality, not truth. Most people in the world knew or suspected that the war grounds put forward by the US were lies, but they could not have a decisive influence on reality. The war took place against the wishes and interests of the majority. The power and interests of the United States and the coalition of the willing did more than the interests of the people for peace and well-being.

The same applies to the societies in which the majority of people live. Their need for the security of their livelihoods is increasingly at odds with the prevailing economic system of capitalism, which is the basis of most social systems on our planet. Capitalism, with all its wealth, is less and less able to meet these needs. He is also less and less able to give space to the creative potential of people, their genius, to offer them a glimpse into a world in which precisely this genius could give new impetus to social development, to unleash new forces. to a human-friendly transformation and development of society and nature.

Recognising the contradiction between people's real circumstances and their needs, the key to change lies. But this requires close observation in order to find out where the world and societies are developing. What are phenomena such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the unrest in the Arab world, the West's human rights campaigns against Russia and China?

You can condemn this, take sides for human rights, take sides against the wars, morally outrage and condemn. That is fair, but it does not change much. It is much more important to see what is evident in all these phenomena.

  - What is expressed?

  - What is the development going on?

  - What does it want to become a reality?

  - How can the existing forces influence these developments so that they may be for the benefit of humanity?

  - And what can be done in the circumstances to strengthen the forces that want another, a human-friendly world?

Man has no choice but to live in the present and shape the future from the present. However, we can only shape THE future for which the conditions are already in place in the present. But it is not enough to recognize them, but, when the possibilities are recognized, it is also necessary to boldly translate them into a better future.

The decisive players for this are not the politicians and visionaries of any kind, as so many think. Rather, the decisive factors are these inconspicuous people, who care less and less about the sum in the world. It is the people who, through their everyday, reliable and unobtrusive work, ensure that society continues to function despite the sometimes headless activism of politicians and despite the aggravation of working conditions under the dictates of return.

It is the people who ensure that buses and trains run, that houses are built and that the sick are healed, that drain pipes do not clog and that the bread rolls are on time in the delivery. It is these small humble and unobtrusive people who keep the wheels of society running, but who also have the power to bring these wheels to a standstill. All wheels stand still when your strong arm wants it. They are the yeast in the dough. They are driving the development or not. And because they are not doing anything at the moment, there is also a stagnation in social development everywhere.
