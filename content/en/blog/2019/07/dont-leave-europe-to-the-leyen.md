Brief comments on the Council's staff proposals. Please correct me, but a first brief overview reveals the following:

#### Josep Borrell

{{< image srcwebp="/static/img/content/2019/72.webp" srcalt="/static/img/content/2019/72.jpg" title="Josep Borrell" >}}

A Spanish man who had to resign as president of the European University Institute because he forgot to declare an [annual](https://www.politico.eu/article/borrell-forced-to-resign-over-energy-interests/ "Borrell forced to resign over energy interests")) income of 300,000 euros with an energy supplier, and have more than unworthy behaviour as a diplomat ([1](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20190528/rusia-embajador-espanol-declaraciones-borrell-el-periodico-7478217 "Rusia cita al embajador español por unas declaraciones "inamistosas" de Borrell en EL PERIÓDICO"), [2](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Spanien-veraergert-Mexiko-will-Entschuldigung-fuer-die-Eroberung-4353871.html "Spanien verärgert Mexiko will Entschuldigung für die Eroberung")) and [insider trading]((https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20181127/453212914541/borrell-pagar-30000-euros-venta-acciones-abengoa-video-seo-ext.html "Borrell deberá pagar 30.000 euros por la venta de acciones de Abengoa"). we should also become the EU's external representative?

#### Christine Madeleine Odette Lagarde

{{< image srcwebp="/static/img/content/2019/73.webp" srcalt="/static/img/content/2019/73.jpg" title="Christine Madeleine Odette Lagarde" >}}

A French woman who was found guilty of embezzling [400 million euros](https://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Politik/Deutschland-Welt/Gericht-spricht-IWF-Chefin-Lagarde-schuldig "Gericht spricht IWF-Chefin Lagarde schuldig") of public money in the Tapie case and has never headed a national central bank should head the ECB?

#### Charles Michel

{{< image srcwebp="/static/img/content/2019/74.webp" srcalt="/static/img/content/2019/74.jpg" title="Charles Michel" >}}

A [Belgian](https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/charles-michel-the-compromise-builder/ "Charles Michel, the compromise builder") who could not even form a functioning government in Belgium, and who is in a pact with right-wing radicals, should become President-in-Office of the Council and ensure that increasingly complex national interests in the EU are balanced?

#### Ursula von der Leyen

{{< image srcwebp="/static/img/content/2019/75.webp" srcalt="/static/img/content/2019/75.jpg" title="Ursula von der Leyen" >}}

An unsuccessful German minister who has only been noticed by a mad penchant for overpriced [external](https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-07/ursula-von-der-leyen-berater-ruestung-ausgaben "300 Millionen für externe Berater") consultants, mismanagement and [euphemisms](https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/politik-weitermachen_id_8328701.html "Weitermachen?") ("trend turnaround finances" for the biggest German armament effort since the end of the war), and that of the illiberal Is it supported by states that have previously rejected the conservative Social Democrats Timmermans as radical left, is he to become President of the European Commission?

What a parade of incompetence! Don't leave Europe to the Leyen ...
