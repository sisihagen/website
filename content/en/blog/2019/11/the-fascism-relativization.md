If the owning class is in power without a counter-force of mass-effective strength, this means reactionary politics and exploitation of the majority. That's not new either. The victory of capitalism over feudalism with the slogans of the French Revolution *liberty, equality, fraternity* showed this — this epochal change has not led to the implementation of the progressive demands, for these three slogans. Instead, backward steps were taken to establish and secure power, even with propagandistic means. The first clear expression for this was Napoleon's self-enthronement as Emperor.

In order to divert attention from the fact that bourgeois power is now re-reactionary, the ruling parties use various means, including Propaganda and Repression, as well as the de-legitimation of opponents by double Standards and the filtering of news content. A recent example is provided by the CDU Sachsens, which combines an assembly of one photo each from the war-torn Dresden after the end of the Nazi dictatorship and from a run down street scene from the late GDR, with the same Text as the two epochs: "socialism has only brought suffering, whether national or 'real existent'". Here the society called the real socialist is set with the fascism, which also receives the stamp of socialism, because the Nazis had used the term.

> This is an incredibly trivial parable for fascism: the greatest crime of humanity is put to one level with the history of the GDR. 

Fascism is the open terrorist rule of brutal exploiters in Power. The Nazi state carried out the mass murder industrially, systematically operated from the surveillance of the entire population, the planned Deportation to the Holocaust itself, which was planned as a genocide. The Nazis used their Propaganda against a supposedly Jewish-Bolshevik world conspiracy. As a result, they fought a war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, to which 27 million Soviet citizens fell victim. The Second World War led to more than 60 million deaths, a crime without any historical comparison. The six million murdered Jews are still more in the memory of humanity than the other victims.

The Sachsen-CDU justifies its representation, which the GDR parallels with fascism figuratively and textually, with the Argument: "the two pictures show where socialist experiments have taken place. We have no interest in repetition". This argument adds to the equation of the two systems a complementary history slackening, since it calls fascism again and out of government *socialist*. The Nazis, however, had brought the socialists and Communists at the beginning of their reign in the concentration Camps and mass murdered. 

The equalization of the two forms of state as elements of totalitarianism, whereby extremes from the left and right touch the edges of the political spectrum, this Manipulation is repeated in bourgeois rule since the beginnings to the present day. 

An example of this is an Interview by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung with the now deceased CDU politician Werner Dolata from the year 2013, in which he formulated: "the similarities prevail between the Nazi period and the GDR". He then differentiated this statement partially, but the statements at the beginning of a text are most likely to adhere to the consciousness of the people.

Another example shows the classification of anti-socialism: The former Chairman of the CDU parliamentary group in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Harry Glawe said in 2009: 

> With the liberation of the last concentration camps and the arrest and later judgment of those responsible, the Holocaust ended with the 8th of May 1945 and thus one of the darkest chapters of German history.  At the same time, however, 8 May 1945 marks the beginning of a further dictatorship for the new Länder, accompanied by historical interpretations and prescribed silence.  Under the sign of Hammer and sickle began new Injustice. So it certainly belongs to the dark chapters of our history, that in concentration camps (...) also after 8. May 1945 was tortured and murdered. The victims of the two German dictatorships must not be forgotten.

The GDR was a state which violated political human rights, in which there was the death penalty and he was responsible for several hundred victims on the German border. He followed Oppositionals with human rights-violating Repression and had a spying system that caused fainting feelings in many people. The leadership promised in many ways the opposite of what took place on many levels of life in real life. This began with the name "German Democratic Republic", which it never did justice to.  

But what about democracy in the West? 

> Those who accuse the GDR alone of undemocratic practices, but on the western side do not recognize undemocratic power strategies, will pick out from reality only what benefits it. It hides, among other things, the fact that communists and other Oppositionalists in the FRG were suppressed by measures that violated human rights, for example by the KPD ban. 

On 17 August 1956, 199 KPD party offices were searched and closed, printing works seized, Material secured, newspapers banned, party assets confiscated and officials arrested; members were financially sanctioned. 

> For example, Heinz Renner — who was a member of the parliamentary council involved in the drafting of the Basic Law — is retrospectively denied his pension as a Nazi victim because of his membership of the KPD.

The protection of the Constitution later admits that the KPD"did not plan any attacks on parliamentary democracy". However, there has never been any compensation for the victims.

The KPD ban does not only affect communists: "everything that did not fit in the direction of Adenauer's politics was put into the Communist suspicions," says the lawyer and book author Heinrich Hannover. "The Gummi paragraph" violation of the KPD ban " has been applied to all possible, allegedly left-motivated acts. By 1968, there were more than 125,000 prosecutorial investigations and about 10,000 convictions".

In the 1970s, the professional bans for so-called constitutional enemies followed, which sought in the Federal Republic of Germany a job as a teacher, but also as a private employee:

> Between 1972 and 1990 there were 3.5 million reviews of members or candidates in the civil service. Affected members of the DKP and of other Communist parties and groups, young socialists and SPD-members, young Democrats, the FDP, Christians, and pacifists, if they had been working with Communists in the student, peace, environmental or solidarity movement. The 35,000 Dossiers led to 11,000 non - professional and 2,200 disciplinary proceedings, 1,250 final opposition from candidates and 265 layoffs from the civil service. Failed appointments at universities and promotions no one counted. The following were affected: postmen and customs officers, train drivers and graveyards, administrative staff and professors, lawyers and doctors, most often: teachers and social educators. Tens of thousands of court cases followed, including the Federal Constitutional Court and the European Court of human rights. 

These undemocratic machinations of the West German perspective by no means the violations of democratic rights in the GDR, but they reveal that the totalitarianism Propaganda of anti-communism measures of double standards. The impact of the CDU's handling of the Left party in connection with the Thuringian Parliament elections is currently clear. In the wake of the protests, the president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko has called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.: 

> We want to replace the left at the government, not prolong their reign. Clear demarcation to the left, clear demarcation to the right (...) — this is our strategy. With the left and the AfD, the two parties on the margins of politics, we do not want to coalition."He founded this with the position of Bodo Ramelow, among other things, that the GDR was not an unjust state. Quote: "Ramelow and his left party, for example, are still not willing to call the GDR an unjust state.

He, like his party, the left and the AfD, equates according to the theory of totalitarianism, and, equally bad: in the application of the term "unjust state" for the GDR, a parallelization of the GDR with fascism is again included. This term was introduced by Fritz Bauer-the public prosecutor, who in the anti-communist climate of West Germany against fierce resistance had enforced the Auschwitz trial-to the Nazi state in the early 1950s in the legal assessment. Fritz Bauer took the term narrowly and stated that the state of Hitler was "not a state governed by the law, but a state governed by the law".

To this end, the reasoning of a judgment of the Braunschweig Regional Court of March 1952: 

> The criminal chamber is of the opinion that the National Socialist state was not a state governed by the law but an unlawful state which did not serve the benefit of the German people. The question of the constitutionality of the Nazi state does not need to be addressed here. All that the German people, starting from the Reichstag fire on 30 July 1934 and 9 November 1938, had to pass through, was screaming injustice, the elimination of which was commanded. It is hard, bitter and hard for a German court to have to pronounce something like this

The importance of dealing with the term "unjust state" is also evident from the fact that the dispute over dealing with the GDR's past has already contributed to the failure of red-red-green exploratory talks at least twice.

"There is no real life in the wrong," Adorno once said. 

> If the concept of power is adopted on the part of the anti-capitalists, then this reinforces the manipulators, here even in the sense of the trivialization of fascism and thus also in the interest of neo-Nazis, who thereby gain in Hope and vote. 

The Propaganda of equating the GDR with the Nazi period also acts as a lowering of the threshold for the election of today's Nazis and their precursors.

And the false interpretation of right and left endangers not only democracy, but our whole life, as can be seen from pictures of Dresden, Berlin and the Ruhr area at the end of fascism in 1945.
