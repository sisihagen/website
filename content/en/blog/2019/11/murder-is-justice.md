> Last night, the United States brought the world´s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization in the World. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my Administration. U.S. Special Operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid into Northwestern Syria to accomplish this mission.

So Donald Trump shouted his message into the microphones, with which he wanted to tell the world a week ago that he is Obama 2.0. The leader of the Western bulwark against Assad, Islamic State, Baghdadi is dead.

"A great night for the United States and the world", Trump said, "the world is now a much better place". He thanked his helpers in Idlib, also Russia, because they had cleared the airspace for the cowards in Bomber steel uniform over Barisha.

#### Russia wonders like others

This is not shared by all. Russia immediately distanced itself and announced doubts about the presentation of Trumps. It is precisely "[the world](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article202556016/Trump-bestaetigt-Tod-von-al-Baghdadi-Russland-bezweifelt-Angaben.html "Russland bezweifelt Trumps Angaben zum Tod al-Baghdadis")", a Russian-speaking "newspaper", that Major General Konashenkov said that Russia had not been informed about the deployment. The Russian investigation has also not registered any air attacks in the Idlib Region. The danger of terrorism in the Idlib area is by no means banned.

The pose of Trump can also be found disgusting. With the forces in Syria connected with it the world thinks he would have been there Live in the murder.

Why not the voyeurism of a state is criticized, my sense of justice is beyond. Obama comparisons were announced. The assassination of Osama bin Laden in 2011 was a similar Situation that was [staged](https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/foto-von-donald-trump-nach-toetung-von-baghdadi-asymmetrisch-a-1293687.html "Trump-Foto von Baghdadi-Tötung - Bildausfall") with another "swag and style". Trump was the center of the scene that ended up being stiff and authoritarian in contrast to the living Obama.

Many also doubt that here a decisive success in the fight against bulwark IS was accomplished and no it is not only Russia. Baghdadi may have been the face, but he is only a minor figure vis-à-vis strategy, planner and executive bodies. It could also lead to a tightening of the structures within the bulwark IS. The murder was more a liberation of the afflicted Trump than a decisive blow to the bulwark IS. 

#### What did Trump mean by "justice"?

Why don't the media ask the important questions? Why doesn't anyone ask what Trump means by "Baghdadi was "brought to justice"?

Law, justice, and righteousness are Translations of the word justice. Where does such an action like Operation Kayla Mueller have room for these words? These words do not play a role in the murder. Justice? What does this have to do with killing a person without a state trial? This is called in the colloquial language of lynching. The West would call it Terror, the base the Terror can be further spread. Where is the difference between showing a bond and the same through a man in Uniform with a national coat of arms on his Arm? We should also ask ourselves Where is the difference between an Islamist and a Christian who says "They will not escape the final judgment of God"? But we'd have to ask ourselves first Where are the media that ask such questions?
