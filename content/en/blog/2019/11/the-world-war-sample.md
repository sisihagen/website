The military-industrial complex consisting of NATO, the Bundeswehr, the
federal government and the" Ministry of defence", the defence industry
and strategy developers ensure that the public as far as possible does
not receive information about the fire-threatening activities. He
prefers to be able to carry out his business, planning and maneuvers
without public attention and without criticism and Protest. While the
critical nuclear scientists have put their watch on the warning of the
nuclear war on two to twelve, the air force of the German armed forces
and other NATO military are testing the opening of the nuclear war. You
risk the end of civilization. The peace forces will work together
against the nuclear threat in the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima.

This autumn, the Bundeswehr has simulated the nuclear Inferno in
conjunction with other NATO\"partners". The scenario for the maneuvers
of the [air and nuclear
war](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/atomkrieg-bundeswehr-trainiert-mit-nato-den-ernstfall-16439019.html "Bundeswehr trainiert mit Nato den Ernstfall")
on Germany. The US nuclear warheads B-61 are likely to be equipped with
"Tornado" jet fighters and fly towards the target area.

This is the secret alliance exercise "Steadfast Noon". The symbolism
states that it is no longer five to twelve, but that the hour has
already struck twelve.

For this purpose, the critical nuclear scientists presented their
Doomsday Clock, the clock for warning of the nuclear war, on two to
twelve.

Shortly before the maneuver, B-52 bombers, whose predecessors had
already been used for bombardments in the Vietnam War, landed on the
British base in Gloucestershire. The US Air Force\'s military have been
dubbed a news announcement on the internet about the landing of these
carrier weapons in Europe with the words: "[enemy beware: Bombers are
back and ready to take
off](https://www.usafe.af.mil/News/Press-Releases/Article/1986027/adversaries-take-notice-bombers-are-back-and-ready-to-roll/ "Adversaries take notice: Bombers are back and ready to roll")\".

The message clearly expresses the willingness to Inferno that threatens
Europe\'s civilization and its population. The peace-policy spokesperson
of the parliamentary group die LINKE, Kathrin Vogler,
[annotated](https://www.kathrin-vogler.de/start/aktuell/details/news/sie-trainieren-unsere-vernichtung/ "Sie trainieren unsere Vernichtung!"):

The former Federal President Gustav Heinemann called the nuclear weapons
in his Bundestag speech against the atomic armament of the German armed
forces on 25. March 1958 "vermin-killers, in which this time the man is
the vermin is supposed to be". In his opinion, he called these only"
so-called weapons", since their use can mean "our all suicide", they
"are the principle abolition of all martial law, (...) the end of all
achievements of Occidental culture". His consequence was then:
"self-defense with mass destruction is impossible."

The speech of Heinemann was then directed against the plans of the
CDU-Adenauer-government and its military minister Franz Josef Strauss to
equip the Bundeswehr nuclear. This request led to the expansion of the
peace movement, buoyed by the appeal of the göttingen professors "fight
the nuclear death!\". Among the authors were physicist Max Born and
atomic researchers Otto Hahn, Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich
Freiherr von Weizsäcker. The 18 Professors made their appeal, among
other things:

> No natural limit is known for the development of the life-killing
> effect of strategic nuclear weapons. Today a tactical atomic bomb can
> destroy a small city with a hydrogen bomb, but a land of the size of
> the Ruhr area temporarily uninhabitable. By spreading radioactivity,
> hydrogen bombs could probably eradicate the population of the Federal
> Republic already today. We have no technical means of safely
> protecting large populations from this danger. (...(I) for a small
> country like Germany, we believe that it still protects itself best
> today and that it is still the best way of promoting world peace if it
> expressly and voluntarily renounces the possession of nuclear weapons
> of all kinds.

The official reduction of the Infernal danger, which continues to this
day from an atomic escalating war, made clear the words of Chancellor
Adenauer in an Interview on 5 April 1957, in which he stated that the
tactical nuclear weapons were "nothing more than the further development
of artillery", and of course the Federal Republic would have to \"
participate in the normal armament the latest

The Anti-nuclear movement, which started at that time, resulted in the
Easter March movement, and was a predecessor of the great successes of
the peace movement of the 1980s, in which it was said again: "Against
the nuclear threat act together!\".

It is telling a lot that the military and the government carry out and
approve the maneuver "Steadfast Noon" behind the veil of concealment.
They have gained experience with the resistance. The peace and ecology
movement are called, the statements of the enemies of life and Survival
with a widening of the protest to cross.

A maneuver that endangers, allows and carries out the peaceful
coexistence of people and life at all, is a scandal that also amounts to
a breach of law:

An Advisory opinion of the International court of justice in The Hague
from 1996 to the UN General Assembly stating that the threat of use of
nuclear weapons is generally contrary to international law and against
the rules of humanitarian war, international law in Particular. Where
right to wrong, resistance becomes a duty if we want to survive.
