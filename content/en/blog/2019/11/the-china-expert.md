Adrian Zenz is currently the mega-source for all media. From Print
media, Radio to television. The active China Bashing is made not only by
the United States of the desolate. Opening the door is enough.

Mr Zenz is the protector of the Uighurs, a Muslim people in China who
are probably subjected to repression. Zenz was not the voice of the 4
million dead Muslims that the West has slaughtered since the war on
Terror. That certainly did not fit into one\'s own worldview. The resume
makes it understandable that others are the bad guys, but not the fine
Christian West.

Who is Adrian Zenz? The day-to-day show is quite straightforward when it
comes to the presentation of its "China expert". Zenz "is regarded
worldwide as a renowned expert on the Situation of Muslims in China.
Zenz lives and works in the United States of America."Of course, that
sounds serious. But where did the "world renowned expert" actually work
exactly? According to the science database
[ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8648-8363 "Adrian Zenz - ORCID"),
Zenz is active at the European School of Culture and Theology in
Korntal, Baden-Württemberg. The very least of them will have heard of
this school so far and that is understandable. The TRUST belongs to the
Academy for world mission, a rather peripheral Evangelical educational
institution, which is closely associated with the also in
Korntal-established Association of Evangelical missions, including the
Evangelical "Chinese mission community". The FAZ compared to Zenz
describes themselves as "deeply religious," and speaks of a "vocation",
and that God had directed him there, on a "prepared way".

According to his own entry at
"[Academia](https://ciu.academia.edu/AdrianZenz "Adrian Zenz - CIU")\",
Zenz is also working at Columbia International University, where he
oversees the doctoral students of the Korntaler ESCT. PhD students from
a private evangelical school at Columbia University? Yes, because
Columbia International University is not to be confused with the
prestigious New York Columbia University, but a dubious evangelical
Bible School in Columbia, South Carolina. Their
"[doctorates](http://www.ciu.edu/academics/graduate-seminary-programs/doctor-of-philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy")"
to be reached online are probably to be assessed rather than as a
bizarre rather than as a "renowned science". By the way, compared to the
FAZ, Zenz has indicated that he does not earn his money as a scientist,
but as a "freelancer in the IT industry". His studies in China are
probably more of a Hobby, which he pursues in his spare time. This
scientific background is not particularly renowned. That all sounds more
like a religiously guided hobby scientist.

Zenz\'s reputation comes from a completely different source. Adrian Zenz
is
[Additionally](https://jamestown.org/analyst/adrian-zenz/ "Adrian Zenz - Jamestown")
"Senior Fellow" for China Studies at a dubious Think Tank called
"Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation". In this function, thanks to
his extreme statements on Chinese politics, he got into a citing cartel
of right-wing and transatlantic Think Tanks. This is obviously
sufficient for the Newsreel to be regarded as a" world-renowned expert".

Who or what is "Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation"? This is a
Think Tank that has set itself the task of freeing the "free world" from
the "false hopes of communism". VOC emerged from the anti-communist
factions around McCarthy\'s Committee for un-American deterrence and the
reactionary factions built upon it that were installed around the
intelligence services in the Cold War era. VOC was founded in 1993 by
the Cold Warriors Lev Dobriansky, Lee Ewards, Grover Norquist and
Zbignew Brzezinski. The current Chairman Lee Edwards was formerly the
Chiang Kai-shek, close to the standing [Committee for a Free
China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/02/02/the-death-rattle-of-the-china-lobby/d5828448-a9e9-4b0d-a765-687ab73f9108/ "The Death Rattle of the China Lobby")
and founder of the American Department of the [World Anti-Communist
League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_League_for_Freedom_and_Democracy "World League for Freedom and Democracy"),
an extreme right-wing international, also of Chiang Kai-shek initiated
anti-Communist League, which included, among other things, so
"illustrious" persons, such as Otto Skorzeny (Waffen-SS, Organisation of
former SS members), Ante Pavelić (ustasha of Croatia) and
\[numerous\](<https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-YAnJOkt3G0B4uEGh/Scott+&+Jon+Lee+Anderson+-+Inside+the+League+(1986%29_djvu.txt>
"Full text of "Scott & Jon Lee Anderson - Inside the League")
commander-in-chief of the Latin American death squads attached.

VOC\'s adviser is John K. Singlaub, a 98-year-old former Major General
of the U.S. Army, who is one of the founders of the CIA and has led the
CIA operations in the Chinese civil war. In 1977, Singlaub had to resign
after publicly criticizing President Carter\'s announced withdrawal of
U.S. troops from South Korea. After that, he founded the "Western Goals
Foundation" with like-minded people, a private intelligence service that
organized the arms deliveries to the extreme right-wing Contras in
Nicaragua during the Iran-Contra affair. The "Western Goals Foundation"
was described by one former member as "a collection of Nazis, fascists,
anti-Semites, malicious racists and corrupt egotists". \^ "The World
Anti-Communist League". By the way, the United States Council for World
Freedom was founded with financial help from the [reactionary government
of
Taiwan](https://militarist-monitor.org/united_states_council_for_world_freedom/ "United States Council for World Freedom") -- on board was also Lev Dobriansky, the co-founder of VOC.

Who financed the VOC today, remains in the Dark. The right-wing Think
Tank lives on [anonymous million
grants](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/521920858 "VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM MEMORIAL FOUNDATION INC")
and appears mainly as a keyword for the think Tanks related to the
military-industrial complex, when they once again need ammunition
against the left-wing governments in South America or even against
China. Is a serious, scientific analysis of Chinese politics to be
expected from this environment?

Adrian Zenz, according to his own data, was once in the province of
Xinjiang -- 2007 as a Tourist. For his studies, he has explored freely
accessible internet sources, such as calls for tenders and job offers
from the Chinese government in the province of Xinjiang, and then, on
this Basis, has established estimates of the extent of internees in
Chinese re-education camps. Compared to the FAZ, he describes these
estimates as "speculative".

Of course, all these background information does not say that there are
no re-education camps in the province of Xinjiang. The number of "one
Million inmates" who are sent by our media via the "expert" Cenz is,
however, more than questionable and like an internet researcher like
Cenz, who has not been in the Region for 12 years, wants to make
reliable statements on Details, is also a mystery.

Of course, the media are also happy to report critically on the
suppression of the Uighurs in the province of Xinjiang. However, whether
it serves the credibility of relying on such dubious "experts" is
questionable. Anything other than questionable the Concealment of the
background of the "experts" Zenz, however, is. Because if the audience
and readers do not know this background, they can not make their own
picture about the seriousness of the statements and information. But
you\'re not supposed to. This is how opinion-making works.
