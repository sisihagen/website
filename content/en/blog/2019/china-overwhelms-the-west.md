Because it cannot be what must not be, the West still paints a critical picture of China. Where would we end up if the inhabitants of Western countries realized that there is an effective alternative to neoliberal capitalism, in which the few do not siphon off the cream produced by the many? Where would we be when we learn in the West that a fair social policy, an ecological civilisation and human-oriented research are possible?

It used to be funny, but suddenly it's not anymore. In the past, blind hatred of China could be attributed to ignorance, or at least to indoctrination by Western propaganda and mass media. And today? China's huge leap forward, its excellent, humane social policy and its decidedly human-oriented scientific research, as well as its path to a so-called "ecological civilization" is well documented, so does anyone really want to knowledge, there are plenty of ways to learn the truth.

#### China's standing in the world

But it seems that very few want to know something — at least in the West. In almost all Western countries and their satellite states, China is viewed negatively. Surveys in countries like Africa, where China interacts intensively with people and helps them break the dependency chains of their neocolonial masters from Europe and North America, clearly show that it is admired and appreciated.

Last year, a survey by the prestigious Pew Research Center found that non-Western countries overwhelmingly rate China favorably: 67 percent in Kenya, where China participates in large-scale infrastructure and social projects, and 61 percent in Nigeria, africa's most populous nation; Seventy percent in Arab Tunisia, 53 percent in the Philippines and 65 percent in Russia, which is now its closest ally.

In the UK, 49 per cent of citizens view China positively, 48 per cent in Australia, but only 39 per cent in Germany and 38 per cent in the US.

What is truly shocking, however, is the West's attitude towards China's President Xi Jinping, a determined thinker who leads China to true socialism with a Chinese omen; which eradicates extreme poverty (in 2020 there will be no more areas of misery in the People's Republic) and which puts culture, a high quality of life, ecology and the general well-being of the Chinese people above economic indicators.

Conservative anti-communist Poland leads the pack: only nine percent of Poles "have confidence" in President Xi's leadership; in Greece it is 11 percent, in Italy 14 percent and in Spain 15 percent. That says all about Europe, especially since the figures are 42 percent in Canada and 39 percent in the United States.

Is it really just ignorance?

In interviews with various Chinese media, the same question is often asked: "Why are we constantly criticized in the West, even though we play by the rules and do our best to improve the planet?"

The answer is obvious: "That's exactly why."

#### Review

About twenty years ago, China was still in an "unfinished stage" with its socialist project. There were large differences in living standards between urban areas in the east and rural areas. Transport left much to be desired. Air pollution in industrial cities was high — very high. Tens of millions of people migrated from the countryside to the cities in search of work and a better life, but this has put a huge strain on the country's social systems.

Those who disliked China found a lot of "ammunition" for their criticism. The country made progress — but making it bloom, making it clean and healthy seemed like a Sisyphean work.

What followed was an absolute miracle, unprecedented in human history. Only the Soviet Union was able to show higher growth and an even greater improvement in living standards for its own people before World War II than China has in the past two decades.

#### The big changes

Everything changed in China. The cities became clean, green, ecological, full of public parks, sports equipment for children and adults. Urban centres now flow from world-class, fully transport-ecological means of transport, with impressive museums, concert halls, excellent universities and medical centres. Subsidized high-speed trains connect all major cities in the country.

In Communist China, the government and the Communist Party plan everything, and the private sector serves the nation, not the other way around. It works. It works remarkably well. Citizens have much more say in how their country is governed than those in the West.

The cities are clean, efficient, built for the people. No beggars and no slums. No misery. Everything is getting better and better.

Foreigners visiting China for the first time are shocked: the country looks much wealthier than Britain or the US. Its streets, its airports, its metros, its high-speed trains, theatres, trottoirs, parks — effortlessly eclipse New York or Paris.

But China is not rich — far from it! Its gross domestic product is still comparatively low, but that is exactly what makes "Socialism with a Chinese omen" so impressive and so superior to the Western capitalist system, controlled by imperialism. China does not need an average annual salary of 50,000 or more US dollars to make its people do well to protect its environment and promote its great culture. Could that be precisely why the West is shaking with fear?

#### And the West?

The West in which people live in constant fear, rather than with optimistic hope for the future. The West, where trillions of dollars and euros are wasted annually, so that elites live in bizarre luxury, where there is irrationally unnecessary overproduction and gun accumulation that does not bring prosperity to the majority.

China, with its centralized planned economy, offers a much better and more logical system to its citizens as well as to the world.

The bulk of science aims to improve life on this planet and not to generate cold profits.

The Belt and Road Initiative, launched by President Xi, aims to lift billions of people around the world out of poverty and connect the world, rather than fragment it. So why is President Xi so much rejected in Europe? Could it be that it is precisely because of China's gigantic success?

#### Western propaganda

Twenty years ago, China had huge social and environmental problems. People in the West came and pointed their fingers at things: "Of course, Shanghai and Shenzhen are wealthy now, but look at the other cities on the coast, do you see the difference?"

Then all the cities on the coast were getting better and better; they started to build parks, universities, metros, beautiful streets.

But the criticism of the West continued: "Now leave the coast, go west and you will see how unequal it is in China!"

After all, western China also improved so much that there was virtually no difference between the quality of life in the cities there and those on the coast.

"It's all so cynical," the tirade continued. "The difference between cities and the countryside is so great that farmers are forced to leave their villages and seek work in the big cities."

Under president Xi, the entire rural area underwent a huge restructuring. Public transport, medical care, educational institutions, and job provision improved so much that in 2018, people began to migrate back to the countryside from the city.

And now? What's next? "Human rights"? There's not much to complain about anymore, if you look closely.

But the better China gets, and the more it cares about its people and others around the world, the more violent the attacks become.

Not a single "wow!" of the Western regime and its mainstream media. Not once: "China is now a world leader in ecology, social policy, science and virtually all public areas." Why?

#### Because what cannot be can't be

The answer is obvious and sadly depressing: because the West does not want China and its president to succeed. Or, if they succeed, they must be kept quiet about it. The two systems are so different that the Western system must be wrong if the Chinese is right.

And the West is not looking for a concept that is good for the world. He just wants his own concept to survive and dominate the planet. Point.

This is what makes China so popular in countries that want to save their people from misery and build a new, better society. That is why China is slandered and rejected, in the West and in a handful of countries outside where Westerners and their descendants control and control the mass media, such as Argentina.

Positively, there are more people who place their trust in President Xi than in US President Donald Trump, who is enthusiastic ally only 27 percent of people around the world.
