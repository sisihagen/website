This is a double scandal:

  - The uranium munitions used in the Yugoslavia wars of the 1990s, Iraq, Afghanistan and again in Syria by the United States and Great Britain have a deadly long-term effect. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people may die from it in the next few years.

  - The Western media don't want to know about it. A science journalist for the German daily [DIE ZEIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Zeit "Die Zeit"), Gero von Randow, has been instrumental in helping to silence these "most adventurous conjectures" the German press – on behalf of, or at least at the request of the editor-in-chief at the time, [Theo Sommer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Sommer "Theo Sommer") and the (still ruling) editor-in-chief and NATO lover [Josef Joffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Joffe "Josef Joffe").

It is to be feared that the media will continue to remain silent on this. Thousands of victims of Nato terror would sue for war crimes and which of the member of the NATO terrorist organisation would be happy about that?

#### What is uranium ammunition?

In the production of the fuel rods for the nuclear power plants and also in the production of atomic bombs, to a certain extent as waste, depleted uranium – [Depleted Uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium "Depleted Uranium"), in the usual abbreviation therefore DU. This cannot be used industrially for anything except military purposes. DU is incredibly heavy – its specific weight is more than twice that of steel – and can thus loosely penetrate the steel armour of a heavy tank, which is built into suitable ammunition.

The projectiles called uranium ammunition are mainly used by the US fighter jets [Fairchild A-10 Thunderbolt](https://militarymachine.com/10-thunderbolt-ii/ "Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II") against tanks. The fact that this ammunition is radioactively radiant and highly toxic is tacitly accepted. Since the 1991 Gulf War, the US Army has used – with the apparent acquiescence of NATO allies, including Germany's – uranium-ripened munitions, bombs and grenades.

#### A tireless journalist has been researching

It is thanks to the German filmmaker and journalist Frieder Wagner that the issue is finally coming back to the table. He has brought his research and travelogues to the war-damaged areas into a book that has just been published by the proMedia publishing house: "[Death Dust – made in USA](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Dust-What-Happens-Bodies/dp/1883620074 "Death to Dust: What Happens to Dead Bodies 1st Edition")".

> When uranium bullets hit their target, the depleted uranium used burns to the tiniest of particles. This ' death dust ' can enter all organs inhaled because it is 100 times smaller than red blood cells and thus also overcomes the mother-child barrier. Uranium particles in Iraq and wherever these weapons have been used so far also contaminate the soil, air and water. They cause cancer. Many generations are harmed for centuries because their genetic code is changing.

> A 1992 study by the UK Atomic Energy Agency says that up to 500,000 deaths from radioactive contamination are expected when 40 tonnes of this ammunition is used in inhabited areas. In the War of 1991 (Second Gulf War. Red.) 320 tons of this ammunition were used alone. How terrible, then, are the consequences of uranium weapons in Bosnia (1995), Yugoslavia (1999), Afghanistan (2001) and the second war in Iraq (2003), where a total of around 2200 tonnes were used? There is alarming evidence that, especially in Afghanistan, from 2001 to the present day, and in the Israeli war against Lebanon in 2006, there was also experimentation with more enriched explosive devices – with the civilian population as guinea pigs.

The publisher says: 

> The documentary filmmaker and author Frieder Wagner has seen and recorded images of horror in the children's hospitals of Iraq. In his films "Deadly Dust – Death Dust" (2007) and "The Doctor and the Outrained Children of Basra" (2003) he reports on the cover-up strategy of the military, industry and governments, but also of the media and politics. His years of study of the subject led him to the contaminated theatres of war, where he, together with the German physician Siegwart-Horst Günther (1925 – 2015), revealed important facts, which now appear for the first time in book form.

#### Frieder Wagner

Frieder Wagner, born in 1942, is a German journalist and filmmaker. He was awarded the Adolf Grimme Prize for his television work. Since 1982, he has been producing his own television documentaries for ARD and ZDF in personal union as a writer, cinematographer and director. His documentary, filmed for the WDR series "Die Story" "[The Doctor and the irradiated children of Basra](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2336518/ "Der Arzt und die verstrahlten Kinder von Basra ")," about the consequences of the use of uranium munitions, was awarded the European Television Award in 2004.

The German Alibi Newspaper Die Welt published a detailed article on the topic of [uranium munitions](https://www.welt.de/gesundheit/article173224341/Uran-Munition-Wie-schlimm-sind-die-gesundheitlichen-Folgen.html "Uran Munition - wie schlimm sind die Folgen") in February 2018. In it you can find an impressive video right at the beginning.
