Ms. Sacharova kindly and not without irony and sarcasm draws up a list for the [US State Department](http://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/spokesman/briefings/-/asset_publisher/D2wHaWMCU6Od/content/id/3672703?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_D2wHaWMCU6Od&_101_INSTANCE_D2wHaWMCU6Od_languageId=en_GB "Briefing by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, June 5, 2019") so that every country knows how to become a friend of the United States. The country is also very busy doing it itself. We can also thank you for that!

According to the media, US Permanent Representative to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison presented Turkey with an ultimatum during a [CNN interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/04/us-nato-ambassador-turkey-must-cancel-russia-s-400-missile-purchase.html "US NATO ambassador says Turkey must back down on Russian missile purchase"): the Turkish Government must abstain from buying S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia if it wants to acquire US-made F-35 fighters. “So, what happens is that they will have to make a choice, they have the right to make that choice, but it is one or the other, not both,” she noted.

The news has arrived that the US ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has issued an ultimatum to Turkey in an [interview for CNBC]. According to the Turkish government, it should refrain from buying Russian S-400 missile complexes if it wants to obtain F-35 fighter jets from the US.

Who else should do something to make the US administration happy?

As I see it, the US Department of State should have done this work. They should post a special rubric on their website and write who should do what to make them happy. We can make a start, and, maybe, they will catch on.

  - Europe must pay for [NATO membership](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-08/trump-said-to-seek-huge-premium-from-allies-hosting-u-s-troops "Trump Seeks Huge Premium From Allies Hosting U.S. Troops") and buy [US-made weaponry](https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/06/01/actualidad/1559389670_532613.html "EE UU da un ultimátum a Europa para que rectifique su plan de defensa"), and it must not cooperate with Russia. Europe must annul Nord Stream agreements and buy US gas at higher prices. European telecommunications companies must not buy cheap and high-quality equipment from Asian countries. Europe must store US nuclear weapons on its territory forever;

  - India must curtail its military-technical [cooperation](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/diplomacy/article/2161925/india-receives-us-warning-over-buying-weapons-russia "India receives US warning about buying weapons from Russia") with Russia;

  - [China](http://vesti7.ru/video/1905233/episode/26-05-2019/ "ЭФИР ОТ 26.05.2019") must charge low duties on US goods, but it must not object to high tariffs being imposed on its goods exported to the United States. China cannot compete with the United States in the telecommunications sector. At the same time, Beijing must give the United States full access to China’s high-tech industry;

  - The [Philippines](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1549891/world "Moscow to supply state-of-the-art weapons to Manila") must not purchase Russian weaponry nor fight the drug mafia;
  
  - Mexico must pay the United States for [building a wall](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/ "Donald Trump stalls on promise to build a wall, have Mexico pay for it") along the border;

  - South Korea must deploy [US missile-defence systems](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2120452/china-wins-its-war-against-south-koreas-us-thaad-missile "China wins its war against South Korea’s US THAAD missile shield – without firing a shot") on its territory and join [sanctions](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2019&no=346275 "S. Korea under pressure to join U.S. anti-Huawei campaign") imposed on a high-tech Chinese company;

  - Japan must forget about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the entire world must recognise that it was the United States that won World War II;

  - Iran must not develop its peaceful civilian nuclear power industry. To be honest, Washington’s demands with regard to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Syria, Venezuela and Iran are so excessive that these states would be unable to fulfil them even if they wanted to. Judging by Washington’s current logic, it would be better for them to disappear altogether. This would resolve all matters.

  - Speaking of Russia, I am afraid to even start listing what it must do.

I have a question: isn’t Washington afraid that the world might, at some stage, ask it to pay for these services after the results of this “must-do” policy are announced?

I cannot help but say that, of course, all countries must also accommodate US military bases on their territories. Just look at the map.
