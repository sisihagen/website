Our history is not new. The blatant lies and stupidity of the incompetent and corrupt elites. The inability to halt the costly, endless wars and reduce the gigantic spending on the military. The plundering of a besieged population by the rich. The destruction of the Ecosystem. The disintegration and abandonment of a once efficient infrastructure. The collapse of institutions that maintain a functioning state, from education to diplomacy. The world has seen all this. It is the well-known disease of the end of a civilization. Initially, it is entertaining in a gloomy way, even in the midst of increasing suffering. But in the end everyone will laugh.

The nature of man does not change. It follows their known and cyclical patterns. The difference is that this time, the whole Planet will go with us. Until the end we are kept under the spell of Fools and swindlers. Because what are demagogues like Donald Trump and [Boris Johnson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Boris-Johnson "Boris Johnson") or representatives of the [Positive psychology](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-good-life/200805/what-is-positive-psychology-and-what-is-it-not "What Is Positive Psychology, and What Is It Not?") and prognosticators of the "best of all possible worlds" as [Steven Pinker](https://newrepublic.com/article/147391/hype-best "Hype for the Best") other than the charlatans who insist that the tragedy that we face is real?

What the technocrats and scientists who want to tell us that education and Western civilization can transform us into rational beings, other than shamans? And what are the corporate titans, who make a fortune with their weapons, chemicals, fossil fuels or environmentally destructive livestock farming industry, other than human victims demanding high priests?

Human history is always the same. Dressed in new costumes and using new tools, we experience them over and over again. If we were still dealing with philosophy, literature, history, poetry and theology, it would not be surprising for us that greed, hedonism and Hybris easily negate empathy and reason.

But because we do not, because we prefer to spend several hours every day pouring out small amounts of dopamine through staring electronic screens, we think there has been nothing like us since the beginning of humanity. We are blind to the fact that the climatic conditions that have enabled civilizations to develop over the past 10,000 years are soon to be replaced by a brutal struggle for survival.

Man has been living on a planet that has existed for 4.5 billion years. Most of these 200,000 years have not been radically influenced by man in the ecosystem of this planet. But the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), which began about 250 years ago, led him to obtain fossil fuels and so — in the form of coal and oil — tap the sunlight that has been stored for a hundred million years.

The fossil fuel-derived energy provided to the industrialized North of the planet, unprecedented wealth and military Superiority. This position of power was used to subjugate most of the rest of the planet and exploit natural resources and labor.

The human population rose rapidly to more than seven billion. The air, the water and the ice cover of our planet have suffered greatly from this rush, the climate is changing. In this new climate, human life will no longer be possible.

The only really existential question is how we want to wait for the final. But asking yourself this question means defying the cultural delusion of hope and the longing for collective self-deception. When the reality is gloomy, you hide it. One invents absolutely unrealistic scenarios of an impending Redemption-which explains how we could end up in the mess in which we are now stuck.

Most climate activists and democracy agents see themselves — like the general consumer culture-as sellers of the product hope. Without hope, they argue, people would return to despair. You couldn't stand the impending disaster.

Of course, the opposite is the case. Hope or, in fact, false hope enhances the feeling of despair and lethargy. It allows a guardianship of the population.

Carbon emissions continue to rise, polar ice caps melt, crop yields decline, [burn the Earth's forests](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836891/amazon-fires-brazil-bolsonaro-rainforest-deforestation-analysis-effects "Everything you need to know about the fires in the Amazon"), coastal towns sink through rising sea levels, and fertile arable land is destroyed by droughts.

But the healers of hope assure us that in the end everything will be fine. Only, it won't! We will not be able to adapt. Those who sell us the false hope that man could adapt to the new conditions, are just as blinded by self-deception as those who dismiss global warming as a hoax. And many people know that, at least subconsciously.

The longer we deny the sad truth in front of our eyes and try to cope with our existential fear and pain in the private, the more paralysing despair becomes.

This schizophrenic existence is a Form of emotional abuse. It is imposed on us by a dominant culture that does not allow us to express a tragic truth. Caught in a censorship, we are forced to perish in loneliness with reality. This undermines our trust in our own perception and judgment.

In her Essay "[an abused woman survived](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIIB.html "LETTERS FROM A WAR ZONE")
" [Andrea Dworkin](https://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-A-Ec/Dworkin-Andrea.html "Andrea Dworkin Biography") wrote about the effects of continued abuse on the Psyche:

> The spirit is slowly shattered over time, shattered into a thousand parts. He slowly sinks into Chaos and despair, broken and barely alive in an impenetrable lap of Isolation. This Isolation is so all-encompassing, deadly, morbid, vicious,and devouring all that exists except it. It is completely surrounded by a loneliness that could not even be shaken by an earthquake.

In addition, Dworkin asked what reality was and defined it as follows:

> A woman who has been abused and escaped knows the answer: reality is when something happens to someone you know is happening and that you can pronounce it, and when other people understand and believe when you say it. This is reality. An abused wife who is completely trapped in her nightmare has lost reality and can't find it anywhere.

Compared to the Earth, none of us lives long. For the cosmos, we are nothing but one-day flies. For one lash, our little life is lit up and then extinguished. In a single life, nothing really Important can be achieved. That is why we must work towards something greater than ourselves.

By taking the courage to deal with the evils of human existence and demand justice — not because it can actually be achieved, because it is impossible in its utopian Form, but because we are so unique and sentient individuals, we can fully live as Dworkin has done. You cannot fight for justice on an abstract level.

The struggle for the benefit of the oppressed must be based on a concrete confrontation with the power usually anchored in the white male patriarchy. It expresses itself in acts of civil disobedience, in the framework of which roads, airports and Pipelines are occupied. Either we destroy the corporative capitalism and imperialism as the cause of the ecological debacle, or these forces will wipe us all out in an unprecedented global genocide.

^The struggle for [climate justice](https://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=13791 "Kofi Annan launches climate justice campaign track") is a struggle at the crossroads of historical and current injustices and an impending disaster, which will prove to be the mother of all injustices if it is allowed to spread freely", writes [Wen Stephenson](https://thebaffler.com/authors/wen-stephenson "Wen Stephenson").

"The current disaster will not only worsen the living conditions of the already oppressed (in fact, it is already doing so), but will most likely make impossible any prospect of economic stability and social justice for present and future generations. So why does the concept of climate justice appear in the US-led debates on climate change? Because in this question of the fight against climate change lurks inherent tension: A tension between the 'Mainstream'climate movement — mostly consisting of white, well-funded and Washington-facing green NGOs which have been fighting for decades for social and ecological justice."

A trade-based resistance has its own raison d'être. He is catharsis. He creates a community between us and others who deal with the darkness by calling it by name but not being subjected by it. In this act of resistance, we can find emotional wholeness, true hope, and euphoria — if not, ultimately, a victory.

"The certainty that there is no salvation, is, in reality, a Form of salvation. In fact, it is salvation," wrote [Emil M. Cioran](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/obituaries/e-m-cioran-84-novelist-and-philosopher-of-despair.html "E. M. Cioran, 84, Novelist And Philosopher of Despair"). "On the basis of this insight, one can shape one's own life and develop a philosophy of history: the insoluble as a solution, as the only way out."

As the great Inquisitor in the novel emphasized the [Brothers Karamazov](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/dostoevsky/brothers.html "Brothers Karamazov"), those persons with the emotional and intellectual strength to face what comes to them will always be in the minority. For it is comforting in a stunning way to exchange one's moral autonomy for humble submission and obedience, especially in times of crisis.

"Undoubtedly, as in the past, there will be free societies in the future," says the philosopher [John Gray](https://www.conservapedia.com/John_Gray_(philosopher%29 "John Gray") in Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals.

"But they will be rare, different forms of Anarchy and tyranny, on the other hand, the Norm. Those needs that can be met by tyrants are as real as those to which freedom answers; sometimes they are urgent. Tyrants promise their subjects safety, and the liberation from the boredom of everyday life. Of course, this is just a confused Illusion. The sad truth of tyranny is that of a life-long waiting. But the eternal romanticism of tyranny lasts, therefore, that it promises their subjects a life that is more exciting than one that everyone could make for themselves. No matter what ultimately becomes of it, Violence begins for the depressed with a feast. Dictators may come to power on the back of Chaos, but their unspoken promise is to drive away the boredom of their subjects."

Despite all this, only about [three to five percent](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world "The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world") of the world's population is needed to challenge the arbitrary rule of the powerful. For this purpose, the reality must first be named and accepted.

It won't be easy. It means to mourn what is inevitable to us: a mass death. It means taking action in the face of a certain defeat, nevertheless, to thwart the Plan of those who want to annihilate us.

The environmental movement, Extinction, Rebellion, plans for the next few weeks and months, the occupation of the important city centres around the globe. We can start with that. By resisting the forces of death, we say yes to life.
