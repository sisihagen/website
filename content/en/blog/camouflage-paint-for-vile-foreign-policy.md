If the Tagesschau actually reports on Kosovo, then the opinion of the government, NATO, the USA is taken over superficially and manipulatively. As a rule, there is no report at all about NATO's flagship company. The first project, which is under NATO's New World Order motto, which means bombing a state, taking away parts from you and allowing the establishment of an independent state, all without the UN. In so doing, it helps to conceal the mendacity of German foreign policy, and Kosovo policy in particular, from the public. The discord is hidden under humanitarian chatter. If that is not enough, of course the Russian is to blame for everything: "But tensions between Albanians and Serbs have remained. They could grow again, partly because the prospects for EU membership are diminishing and Russia is exerting more influence."

The journalists of public propaganda have now degenerated into BILD. It is likely that the offspring will now be recruited by the Spinger Akademie. Research, verification, information are searched in vain, especially on foreign and social issues there is always more incitement than serious journalism.

#### Kosovo

Between 24 March 1999 and 9 June 1999, NATO bombed Yugoslavia on land. Without a UN mandate, contrary to international law and the basic law. A sack full of intriguing lies served as a substitute for a legal basis: the then Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, SPD, his deputy and foreign minister Josef ("Joschka") Fischer, Alliance90/The Greens, and War Minister Rudolf Scharping, SPD, pretended to be with the bombing "to stop the systematic violations of human rights and to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo".

The result of their humanitarian bombing: at least 3,500 deaths, many times the victims of the previous civil war; about 10,000 Yugoslav soldiers killed or injured, 1,500 killed and 5,000 injured civilians, while NATO had to mourn only three victims: one German soldier died when his tank crashed down a slope, two US soldiers died in a Helicopter crash in neighbouring Albania killed. Since the US troops also fired 10 to 15 tons of ammunition with depleted uranium projectiles in Serbia, their deadly dust caused devastating consequential damage, which is still not nearly apprecant. The number of displaced persons reached almost one million.

This made the "humanitarian catastrophe" that NATO supposedly wanted to prevent a reality. NATO broke not only the principles of the UN Charter, but also international law of war. It attacked not only military targets, but also often and ruthlessly protected civilians. Refugee treks, for example. Today, G. Schröder, J. Fischer and R. Scharping can confidently be called a trio of mass murderers, political criminals.

Different data are available on the costs of the war, depending on the expenses, damages and consequential damages that are taken into account. According to a Bundeswehr study, they amounted to at least DM 45 billion, and the follow-up costs were up to DM 600 billion.

The Kosovo war has been hotly debated in the media. At that time, public service broadcasting had not yet fully joined the mainstream media. Critical journalism took place. As an example, the WDR documentary "It Started with a Lie", which was broadcast on February 8, 2001, is to be emphasized.

She pointed out that the claim that NATO bombings were intended to "prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo" was a deliberate deception. It was intended to dazzle the critical German audience. Despite violent protests from the media mainstream (Spiegel, FAZ), the WDR remained courageous in its presentation and rejected the attacks.

The deception was later also confirmed internally by the Bundeswehr. The attack on Serbia was not about 'human rights' and 'humanity', but about 'to bring Yugoslavia to its knees'; As early as 1992, the then Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, FDP, had already issued exactly this goal. He was in The Great German tradition: "Serbia must besterbien!" the propagandists sounded already at the beginning of the First World War. In 1914, William II demanded: "The Serbs must be cleaned up, and soon. Now or never!" Nearly three decades later, Hitler tried to eliminate the "Serbian criminal clique" once and for all. Half a century later, un mediator Cyrus Vance called the NATO-Yugoslavia war "Mr. Genscher's war." (Video, minute 3.10 ff)

The long-serving German Foreign Minister, a former member of the Nazi Party, was not afraid to join forces with the fascist Ustasha terrorists in Croatia and to give them and the Slovenes diplomatic recognition in the event of a separation of the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia. The world experienced a typically German single-handedness, despite the appeasement efforts of the EU, the UN and the CSCE. Chancellor Kohl celebrated German infamy in 1992 as "a great success for us", although the British and even the Americans had explicitly warned against this policy as the likely trigger of a bloody civil war.

Rupert Scholz, the then defense minister, struck the same note as Genscher, referring explicitly to the aggressive historical continuity with Serbia:

> We believe that we have overcome and overcome the most important consequences of the Second World War. But in other areas, we are now dealing with the consequences of the First World War. Yugoslavia, as a consequence of the First World War, is a very artificial construction that has never been compatible with the right to self-determination.

Genscher and Kinkel took the first significant steps towards a war with which Yugoslavia was liquidated and its sub-republics, especially Serbia and its province of Kosovo, were transformed into poor houses. Here, too, the same approach is clearly visible: our "community of values" ascribes itself an "international responsibility" for human rights, democracy and, in general, humanity, and thus tries to disguise the fact that criminal arbitrariness and greed for power are driving forces.

At the end of the carnage, the UNITED States, the predominance of our Western community of values, set up another of its approximately 1,000 military bases in Kosovo. "Camp Bondsteel" is the largest U.S. base abroad since Vietnam, a small-town garrison surrounded by fences and barriers and equipped with an airport. Around 7,000 murderers are stationed there. In addition, there are staff departments of allies, family members, civilian administrative personnel.

The bombing, which was contrary to international law, until the surrender of Serbia initially only led to the establishment of a sham-neutral civilian UN administration of the province of Kosovo, but finally to the occupation by NATO troops. What the goal was in the end. Keeping the UN out of Kosovo. This was already seen at the UNMIK Passports, which were not applied anywhere except Kosovo. The UN Security Council gave its blessing to the Kosovo Forces (KFOR) by resolution 1244. The Member of the Left, Dr. Alexander Neu:

> It is a feat that the attacker, the actor who attacks, can then sit down as a peacekeeper with a Security Council resolution and occupy an area.

ARD-aktuell reports next to nothing about Germany's underlying interests in Serbia. When the government in Berlin formally recognized Kosovo as a state in 2008 and thus unquestionably contradicted international law, ARD-currently found nothing really bad about it. Tagesschau.de like a taste of the like-

> The bending of international law is problematic ... but the stabilization of a traditionally fragile region is more important ... Leaving Kosovo to its own devices would not be an option.

Kosovo was now a NATO protectorate, that was the main thing. Compare this demonstratively uncritical allegiance to the Federal Government and transatlantic love-giving with the gezeter, with which the Tagesschau accompanied the democratically decided secession of Crimea and its admission to the Russian Federation!

Never did the Tagesschau only allow facts and objective facts to speak. The "Values West" had better options for action against the corrupt and mafia structures in Kosovo than an occupying regime. The media tale of alternativelessness, also promoted by the Tagesschau, was intended to suggest that the Declaration of Independence was based on a sovereign decision of the Kosovars and had not been prescribed to them by the occupiers. Shortly before the declaration of independence, the EU had decided on the greatest interference in its history with the Eulex mission: 1,800 civil servants, police officers, judges, prosecutors, customs officers, prison officers and administrative experts, most of them from Germany. and Italy, as a quasi-occupation body, should teach the Kosovars how their state should function. This is reminiscent of the connection of the GDR to the FrG.

There is no end to the misery in Kosovo. Once a thriving and prosperous Yugoslav province, Kosovo has become the poorest country in Europe. The average income is barely more than 3,000 euros per year, unemployment is over 27 percent, and about 53 percent of all young people are out of work. But child labour is plentiful, boys and girls are exploited mainly as street vendors (selling cigarettes), in housekeeping and agriculture. Their average age varies between 12 and 13 years. Your daily earnings (at least 4 hours after school ing) are estimated at 7 euros. Horrific conditions ...

Economic growth has in fact not existed since 1999, despite the occupation of the West. The 'growth' after 1999 reported in the statistics is mainly due to international aid, the increase in public services and remittances from Kosovars living abroad. The glaring disproportion between imports and exports has not changed during the occupation. In 2015, Kosovo imported goods worth 2.63 billion euros, but only exported goods worth 0.335 billion euros. Krasser cannot run out of a dismal state's foreign trade deficit.

Germany is taking advantage of Kosovo's unfortunate situation in the interests of its own export industry. Last autumn, the Federal Government did not object to the Kosovo government's decision to arbitrarily impose a special import duty of 100 percent on cheap Serbian goods. Only then did German goods become competitive, and Germany became Kosovo's no. 1 importing nation. The nasty flip side of the coin: the price of bread in Kosovo has risen by a third, and this is particularly true of the poorer population.

What does the "Values West" care about, what does it itch the Tagesschau editor? Germany has achieved double success: business with Kosovo and economic pressure on Serbia. Belgrade may now even have to limit its protective function for the Serbian minority, which lives in the north-west corner of Kosovo under constant threat from the Albanian majority.

Germany has spent around EUR 3.5 billion on Kosovo as part of its completely misguided foreign policy, with no visible positive consequences. Nevertheless, the government proposal for the extension of the Bundeswehr mandate states:

> Germany contributes significantly to the social and economic development in Kosovo ... In addition, the Federal Government promotes good governance, in particular democratisation, civil society, judicial reform and public finances.

Diplomatically speaking: high-sounding unrealistic shit. The federal government is lying down the blue from the sky, and ARD-aktuell makes the political weather report, no different from BILD and the rest of the mainstream media.

Kosovo continues to suffer from rampant corruption and mafia-like power structures that do not allow social improvements or other social progress. Where organised crime prevails, no democratic entity can survive.

On the Transparency International corruption index, Kosovo ranks 93rd out of 176 countries. The biggest misuse of public money is in procurement: every year, state institutions award around a thousand contracts worth 500 million euros, a quarter of the state budget. 100 million of them go into dark channels. You could see it beautifully at the power station. 2 trucks with oil arrived, but one was only emptied. Despite this considerable damage and unspeakable waste of taxpayers' money, the perpetrators and criminal beneficiaries are hardly held accountable.

The EU mission Eulex, with its last 800, originally 1,800 employees, was primarily intended to teach the Kosovars the rule of law. A shot in the oven. Worse, the Eulex force itself proved untrustworthy. Eulex prosecutor Maria Bamieh accused her colleagues of covering up corruption cases and then lost her post. In November 2017, Howard Simmons, the eulex chief judge, accused the mission of corruption and resigned. Eulex responded by claiming that there were serious allegations against Simmons. Commentary by the editor-in-chief of a Kosovar daily newspaper:

> Instead of Europeanising Kosovo, we have balkanised EULEX.

Eulex had failed after ten years. The mission's tasks have been realigned since 2018. How nice: Investigations and prosecutions are now in Kosovo's place. The buck was made a gardener.

Although ARD-currently is legally obliged to report on such substantial events during a Bundeswehr deployment abroad, the editorial staff does nothing of the sort. Why not? Because informative reporting could increase the displeasure of the German public about militarization, awkwardness, right-wing nihilism and the failure of our foreign policy and is therefore not in the interests of the Federal Government?

Our state-supporting journalists remain silent when it becomes critical. Even when the President of our neighbouring Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, became clear on 11 September 2019:

> A state headed by war criminals does not belong to the community of democratic states.

Zeman's verdict was in response to the recent resignation of Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj. Haradinaj was again summoned by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. He is to testify there to the UCK, an Albanian paramilitary organization that fought for Kosovo's independence. It is strongly suspected of having committed the most serious crimes in the 1990s, from massacres of the Serbian civilian population to the torture and vivisection of prisoners, trafficking in human beings and organs. Leaders of the UCK now sit in the parliament in Pristina and have risen to the top of the state. Haradinaj is also a member of this circle, and despite his resignation, he continues to do the official business unabated.

Czech President Zeman promised to ask his country's government to withdraw recognition of Kosovo as a state. He warned that the Czech Parliament did not recognise Kosovo's independence and that the government in Prague had not obtained a corresponding parliamentary decision, which was contrary to the EU's understanding of democracy.

President Zeman's comments, although of the greatest European political significance, did not prompt news in the Tagesschau. If the Berlin Federal Government can live with suspected serious criminals in Pristina, why should noble journalists get upset?

Haradinaj was indicted more than 15 years ago before the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, but had to be acquitted for lack of evidence; Almost all of the witnesses suffered from memory gaps suddenly during the trial or had died in mysterious circumstances before they could testify. The Foundation for Science and Politics, a think tank funded by the Federal Government, reported back in 2007:

> Foreign investigators have created extensive dossiers showing the local and international criminal links of The leading political figures in Kosovo in the form of organization charts. For example, several German-language newspapers, citing intelligence documents, named the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj, the leader of a structure based on his family clan, which covers the entire spectrum of criminal, political and military activities that affect the security situation in Kosovo and the region. The "activities" would focus on drug and arms smuggling and the illegal trade in goods subject to customs duties.

Uncle Otto and Aunt Erna wouldn't even touch a Haradinaj with the pint, according to this official tip from a state science institution. Chancellor Merkel, however, had the guy roll out the red carpet in June of this year and received him officially. Because it cannot be what must not be: namely, that their government, on behalf of the German people and with their taxpayers' money, brought a corrupt dirty regime to the helm in Kosovo and has been feeding through ever since.

Taking the sense of decency of a Czech statesman as an example? Where would our top political staff go! How did one expect the Tagesschau to make a corresponding journalistic U-turn for reasons of decency and journalistic duty?

Andreas Ernst described the situation in Kosovo as:

> The institutions are firmly in the hands of the political elite and are used by it to enrich themselves and their supporters. The parties are actually clientele systems in which followers are exchanged for jobs and orders. On the other hand, after the war, the international protectors quickly came to terms with this elite, because they realized that these people could guarantee stability and, conversely, threaten instability. The protectors of stability were more important than the rule of law and democracy, this elite could establish itself.

In the Bundestag, the AfD, of all people, used this steep bill to portray itself as the cleaner of German politics. Your deputy Armin-Paulus Hampel (oh yes, oh so, the man used to be head of the ARD foreign studio in New Delhi!) presented the product of German foreign policy to the members of the CDU, CSU, SPD, Greens and FDP:

> The result is a so-called failed state, a criminal state ruled by criminals. Drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, arms trafficking, money laundering in every sense: you can read this in every international agency. Up to the highest levels of government, the Kosovar government is riddled with criminals, and the president, who is up there at the top, Mr Thaci was already in court and should be indicted. But all the witnesses in this trial have been killed. I have not heard any outcry in the German Bundestag.

As painful as that is, it is not even possible to say that the AfD man is wrong. Saying what is the case is often reserved for political outsiders and satirists these days. As apt as this:

> The Kosovo (no one knows which article is the right one, least of all the local population) is a would-be country in the Balkans. State borders make no sense, both politically and ethnically ... international status is not even clarified in the European Union.

German Kosovo balance sheet to date. Twenty-seven dead soldiers, almost all of them died in accidents after the end of the war or took their own lives and a total cost of 3.4 billion euros. In 2019, at least EUR 20 million will again be pumped into this region without international law status. What does the Tagesschau report? According to Dieter Hildebrandt, she masters the kowtowing to the federal government, but not the journalistic craft, let alone his professional morality.
