The United States is a [kamikaze](https://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/kami/Kamikaze "Kamikaze")  nation, as well as the Imperial Japan before the war. The United States can be compared with the Third Reich. The USA wants to dominate the whole world. The only freedom, the United States is its own freedom to dominate everything else. The USA deserve no more confidence than criminals, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. Only a single language, such as [Hirohitos](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hirohito "Hirohito - EMPEROR OF JAPAN") Japan understands the United States: the violence. The actions of the war criminal Truman to end the war with Japan should be considered necessarily, for a war with the United States.
