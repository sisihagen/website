Nord Stream II is currently making headlines in all media and among the [Greens](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute/gasprojekt-und-syrien-krieg-baerbock-will-druck-auf-russland-100.html "Baerbock will Druck auf Russland ausüben"), although Gazprom has already announced that the Pipeline will be completed despite the sanctions, but it will probably take another year.

During the agitator campaigners of German media Bulgaria has already started to obtain gas via the new Pipeline TurkStream, which Bulgartransgaz [reports](https://www.reuters.com/article/bulgaria-gas-loan/bulgartransgaz-raises-200-mln-euros-for-turkstream-gas-pipeline-idUSL5N278212 "Bulgartransgaz raises 200 mln euros for TurkStream gas pipeline"). The new route will replace Ukraine and thus save run 35 million euros by eliminating Transit. The [gas price](https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=3226303&cid=9 "Болгария начала принимать российский газ через Турецкий поток") will be 5 percent cheaper, which consumers will already feel in the first quarter of 2020.

Bulgaria will receive three billion cubic meters of Gas annually, a corresponding contract has already been signed which also provides that no more Gas will be supplied by Ukraine. TurkStream also has corresponding connections to Europe in order to supply Gas to Europe without NordStream II and Ukraine if necessary. 

An important step in a secure energy supply, which in the conditions in Ukraine, a president who lets himself be blackmailed by nationalists, nationalists openly propagate Wars, a government that thinks contracts can be changed with hindsight, a bankrupt state, offers more security and confidence!
