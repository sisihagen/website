Recent events in the Region confirm that the US government and reactionary oligarchies are the main ones responsible for the dangerous upheavals and political and social instability of Latin America and the Caribbean.

The First Secretary of the Communist party of Cuba, army General Raúl Castro Ruz, stated on 1. January 2019 prescient: "Those who cherish illusions about the restoration of imperialist domination over our Region, should understand that Latin America and the Caribbean have changed and also the world. [...] The Region resembles a prairie in times of drought. A spark could cause an uncontrollable fire that harms all national interests.“

President Donald Trump proclaims the validity of the Monroe Doctrine and appeals to McCarthyism to preserve imperialist supremacy over the Region's natural resources, to impede the exercise of national sovereignty and the aspirations of regional Integration and cooperation; to seek to restore its unipolar hegemony at the global and hemispheric levels; to eliminate progressive, revolutionary and alternative models to wild capitalism; and regardless of international law, the rules of the game of representative democracy, the environment or the well-being of peoples, to reverse political and Social Conquests and enforce neoliberal models.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday, December 2, threatened to accuse Cuba and Venezuela of exploiting and exacerbating the turmoil in the countries of the Region.  He distorts and manipulates the reality and hides the permanent interference of the USA in Latin America and the Caribbean as a Central Element of regional instability.

The legitimate protests and massive mobilizations of the population on the continent, particularly in the Plurinational state of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil, are caused by poverty and growing inequality in the distribution of wealth; due to the certainty that neo-liberal formulas, let the negative and unsustainable Situation of social vulnerability exacerbate; the Lack of or the uncertainty of health care services, education and social security; by violations of human dignity; through unemployment and the restriction of labour rights; through privatization, inflation and the cessation of public services, as well as the increase in Citizens ' insecurity.

They reveal the crisis of the political systems, the lack of genuine democracy, the discrediting of traditional conservative parties, the Protest against the historical corruption typical of military dictatorships and right-wing governments, the lack of popular support for public authorities, the distrust of institutions and the judicial system.

They are also protesting against the brutal suppression by the police, the militarisation under the pretext of the protection of critical infrastructures and their exemption from criminal responsibility; cause against the use of weapons of war and ordnance, the number of deaths and serious injuries, including hundreds of young people with irreversible injury to the eyes by the use of rubber buckshot; against the criminalization of demonstrations against rapes, beatings, and violence against Detainees, including minors; against the murder of social leaders, demobilized guerrillas and journalists.

The US is defending and supporting the Repression of demonstrators under the pretext of upholding the so-called democratic order. The encouraging silence of several governments, institutions and personalities who are very active and critical of the left is a disgrace. The complicity of the big Information Media is shameful.

The Peoples rightly wonder where democracy and the rule of law have remained, what the institutions supposedly committed to the protection of human rights are doing, and where is the judicial system whose independence is proclaimed.

Let's look at some facts.

In March 2015, President Barack Obama signed an executive order classifying the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, economy and foreign policy" of the great power.

In November 2015, the Left suffered a costly electoral defeat in Argentina.

The neoliberal Offensive had its decisive Moment in August 2016: the parliamentary coup in Brazil against President Dilma Rousseff, the criminalization and imprisonment of the leaders of the Workers ' Party and later of former President Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, with the early participation of the US Department of justice and through the law on corrupt practices abroad. The aim was to establish a dependent government willing to reverse important social conquests through neoliberal adjustments, to enable the catastrophic transformation of the development model, the destruction of national enterprises and the predatory privatization, as well as the cheap sale of the country's resources and infrastructure to the transnational corporations of the USA.

At the end of 2017, there were protests in Honduras against the election result and its terrible repression.

In January 2018, the United States thwart the signing of an agreement between the Venezuelan government and the Washington-controlled Opposition. A month later the foreign Minister announced the validity of the Monroe doctrine and calls for a military coup against the Bolivarian and chavista Revolution.

In March 2018, the gruesome murder of Brazilian councillor Marielle Franco occurred, which triggered a wave of outrage in her country and in the world and whose sinister implications remain hidden by power groups. In April, Lula is arrested using fake legal maneuvers. There is ample evidence of U.S. intervention in the Brazilian elections with the help of specialized companies that use Big Data Technologies and Polymetry to individually manipulate the will of voters, such as those handled by ultra-reactionary Steve Bannon and other Israeli technologies.

During this period, legal proceedings are opened against former presidents Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Rafael Correa.

In April 2018, an attempt is being made to destabilize Nicaragua through external interference and the use of unilateral coercive measures.

On 4 August 2018, President Nicolás Maduro Moros was assassinated.

In January 2019, Washington organized the self-nomination of the unknown and corrupt Juan Guaidó. In March 2019, President Trump renewed the executive order, which Venezuela sees as a threat. On April 30, the attempted military coup in Caracas takes place, which fails, and the US vindictively escalates its unconventional war against the South American Nation, which persistently and heroically resists the civil-military Union of its people.

Throughout the period, the U.S. government applies cruel immigration policies and aggressive, hateful behavior to foster fear and division among voters. It is trying to build the xenophobic wall on the border with Mexico, threatening this country and Central America with terrible tariffs and sanctions if they do not prevent the flight from poverty and insecurity and multiply deportations. It cruelly separates thousands of children from their parents, has arrested 69,000 minors and is trying to expel the children of immigrants born and raised in the United States.

The extreme right-wing government of Brazil under the direction of Jair Bolsonaro began, the United States shamelessly to throw and resorted to lying, xenophobic, racist, misogynistic and homophobic discourses, combined with the insane projections of social and political phenomena, such as climate change, indigenous populations, Amazon fires and Emigration, joined to the refusal of many leaders and organizations. Under her leadership, the social policy that enabled Brazil to significantly reduce the level of poverty and social exclusion during the Workers ' Party government will be dismantled.

Since May 2019, tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to defend themselves against cuts in education, reforms to the pension system, discriminatory measures and gender-based violence.

The Brazilian government has intervened in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and has taken hostile positions towards Cuba in violation of international law.

As the Brazilian press published in April 2019, the State Department instructed 15 embassies to coordinate with those of the United States to urge recipient governments to condemn Cuba in international forums. For the first time since 1992, Brazil voted this year, accompanied only by the United States and Israel, against the Resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which calls for an end to the economic, trade and financial blockade, which the United States is intensifying against Cuba, as well as the cessation of the extraterritorial application of its laws against third countries.

At the same time, the Colombian government abstained from voting on the Resolution, which it has supported since 1992 and which, at a time when it is intensifying, calls for an end to the US's genocidal Blockade of Cuba and its extraterritorial reach. To justify this critical decision, the authorities of this country resorted to ungrateful and politically motivated manipulation of Cuba's altruistic, discreet and unquestionable contribution to peace in Colombia, an issue on which our country's behavior is generally recognized. What is known is the broad and critical debate that this event has provoked in this Nation, which, despite everything, we will continue to accompany in its efforts for peace.

The American slander of attributing Cuba's alleged responsibilities in organizing mobilizations against neoliberalism in South America is an incredible pretext to justify and exacerbate the Blockade and hostile policies against our people.

Similarly, it is useful to protect the Failure of the capitalist system to cover up, wobbling, and repressive governments to conceal parliamentary, judicial and police coups, and to summon the spectre of socialism, the peoples of intimidate. This is also intended to justify the suppression and criminalization of social Protest.

Cuba's only responsibility is that of the example of its heroic people in defending its sovereignty, in resisting the most brutal and systematic attacks, in the constant exercise of solidarity and cooperation with the sister nations of Latin America and the Caribbean.

It hurts imperialism that Cuba has proven that another world is possible and that an alternative model to neoliberalism can be built based on solidarity, cooperation, dignity, equitable income distribution and equal access to professional advancement, security and protection of citizens and full liberation of people.

Likewise, the Cuban Revolution is proof that a close-knit people, who own their country and its institutions and enjoy a lasting and profound democracy, can successfully resist and advance its development despite the longest Aggression and Blockade in history.

The US-orchestrated coup in Bolivia, the OAS, and the local oligarchy to serve as an Instrument, is a Testament to the aggressiveness of the imperialist attack. Cuba reiterates its condemnation of the coup d'état and the brutal repression it has unleashed, and expresses its solidarity with Comrade Evo Morales Ayma and the Bolivian people.

While the US government continues their unconventional war to try to overthrow the legitimately constituted government of President Nicolás Maduro Moros, and the inter-American Treaty on reciprocal assistance (TIAR), by the court reiterates Cuba unyielding desire to maintain cooperation with the government and people of Venezuela.

We express our solidarity with the Sandinista government and the people of Nicaragua, led by President Daniel Ortega, who are facing destabilization attempts and unilateral coercive measures by the United States.

The legitimate government of the Commonwealth of Dominica and its Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit deserve international solidarity and already have that of the Cuban people at a time when this island is the victim of external interference that has already caused violence and wants to thwart the electoral process.

In this complex scenario, the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico opposes neoliberalism and defends the principles of non-interference and respect for sovereignty, while the election of Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández as president and vice president in Argentina expresses the unequivocal rejection of the neoliberal formulas that have impoverished and indebted this Nation and caused serious damage to its people. The liberation of Lula is a victory for the peoples and Cuba reaffirms its call for worldwide mobilization for the demand for its full freedom, the restoration of its innocence and its political rights.

The corruption that characterizes the behavior of the current US government can no longer be concealed. Their impact on the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean costs lives and causes suffering, instability and economic damage.

In the dramatic Phase that the Region and the world are going through, Cuba reaffirms the principles of sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and the right of every people to freely choose and build their political System in an environment of peace, stability and justice without threats, aggression or unilateral coercive measures, and calls for the fulfilment of the postulates of the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace.

Cuba will continue to work on the way of Integration of Our America, which includes the realization of all efforts, the community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac), whose presidency is being taken over by Mexico, promotes the common interests of our Nations through strengthening the unity within the diversity.

The relentless onslaught of the most reactionary forces in the hemisphere, Cuba, contrary to the steadfast resistance of its people and the will to defend the unity of the Nation, its social achievements, its sovereignty and independence, and socialism at any price. We do so with optimism and unwavering confidence in the victory that the Comandante en Jefe of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, has left us, and under the leadership of the first secretary of our party, Army General Raúl Castro, and our President Miguel Díaz-Canel.
