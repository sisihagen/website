Although the polls do not give a majority for Red-Red-Green in the Bundestag, there is already strong opposition to such an alliance. And left-wing politicians are confronted by German pack journalism with the question of whether DIE LINKE is capable of governing. Here are some touchstones:

  1. A party is capable of governing if it does not supply German weapons to warring parties and does not become an accomplice in murder and manslaughter.

  2. A party is capable of governing if it does not send the Bundeswehr into wars contrary to international law.

  3. A party capable of governing is capable of governing if, like the Social Democrats, it advocates an alliance of collective security involving Russia and recognizes that NATO has been developed by the US into a military intervention alliance and is being abused to encircle Russia and China.

  4. A party is capable of governing if it fights growing inequality and, following Article 20 of the Basic Law ("The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state") advocates higher wages, pensions, better social benefits and a fair tax system.

  5. A party is capable of governing if it also sees the interests of the other European countries in the interests of other European countries in the interests of fair neighbourly cooperation and puts an end to wage dumping initiated by Hartz IV, which is seriously damaging european cooperation.

  6. A party capable of governing is capable of governing if it stands up for democracy at European level and opposes the patronising of southern European states by the Troika, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.

  7. A party capable of governing is capable of governing when it recognizes that an economic system geared to increasing profits and turnover inevitably leads to the destruction of the environment.

  8. A party is capable of governing if it shows character when it enters government and does not abandon its principles and its election promises.

Thus, as one quickly realizes, in the neoliberal era of war and exploitation by the parties represented in the Bundestag, the party DIE LINKE is at best capable of governing. Only on the last point do politicians of the LINKEN cast doubt on whether they still know their own programme and have the necessary stamina against the neoliberal, social-mining and war-promoting mainstream, which is also followed by pack journalism.
