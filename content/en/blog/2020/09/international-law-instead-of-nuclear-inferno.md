On the Day of German Unity, the peace movement is demonstrating against a hub of NATO's war planning for what the military calls the "war in the 21st century." In Kalkar, on the northeastern edge of the Ruhr area, NATO and the Bundesluftwaffe, as well as other investors, are expanding a control centre for this "war in the 21st century" behind a fog veil of media non-observance with tens of millions of dollars. The commander of the Bundeswehr's Air Operations Center in Kalkar at the time, Lieutenant General Joachim Wundrak, said in 2016:

> "The location is one of the major players in the German armed forces, but also in NATO."

No wonder, there is an air and space control center for flying military objects here, for an area that stretches from the Gulf via Mali to the North Atlantic to the Russian western border and certainly beyond, as this report of the regionally distributed "[Rheinische Post](https://rp-online.de/politik/ausland/syrien-russische-kampfjets-verfolgen-deutsche-tornados_aid-9667873 "Russische Kampfjets verfolgen deutsche Tornados")" shows:

> "The German pilots have already gained a lot of experience in dealing with Russian military aircraft during the regular Nato air policing missions over the Baltic stake and the Baltic Sea: ... For months, well over 100 warplanes have been over Syria. ... The Air Operations Centre, which entered service in 2013 at the dual Kalkar/Uedem site, is home to 40 Air Force units and services. 'Our space location center will ... together with France, Great Britain, Italy and Spain to provide additional operational services to the EU," says Wundrak: "Among other things, this involves collision warnings for European satellite operators."" ... 1300 soldiers and civilians from 20 nations are now stationed there."

The air control center includes a 24-hour battle station for the leadership of [NATO](https://rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/kleve/nato-standort-kalkar-uedem-waechst-weiter_aid-18939075 "Nato-Standort Kalkar/Uedem wächst weiter") air forces in Europe. It is taking on more and more tasks in the planning, management and commissioning of NATO military air warfare operations and their preparation. "Around 100 million euros would be invested in buildings, infrastructure and IT by 2020, and NATO's multinational battle ground would benefit from a further 30 million euros."

Other institutions include the strategy forthe "War in the 21st Century", the so-called Joint Air Power Competence Center (JAPCC), which was founded in 2005 and is financed by NATO and especially the federal budget. Its annual conferences document the dangerous content of the strategies and the outstanding importance of the JAPCC for NATO. The annual conference [2014](https://nrw-archiv.vvn-bda.de/texte/1518_japcc_jw.htm "Wer zuerst schießt, stirbt als zweiter") said it was doubtful that there would be no more major war in Europe. The 2017 annual conference demanded plans from NATO's [nuclear powers](https://www.japcc.org/deterrence-in-the-21st-century/ "Joint Air & Space Power Conference 2017") to use their thermonuclear potential. The strategists also developed this criminal madness with fiscal reasons, since a conventional defense of the Baltics could be too [costly](https://www.japcc.org/conference-proceedings-2017-panel-2/ "The JAPCC Conference 2017").

The [peace movement](https://essener-friedensforum.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20-10-03Kalkar.pdf "Demonstration für Frieden und Abrüstung 2020") alone protests and informs the national public about the fire-hazardous events in the military facilities of Kalkar. The next occasion for the peaceful enlightenment and protest is a peace demonstration, which the peace movement is holding on the Day of German Unity, October 3, from the Kalkar barracks to the market square in the city.

On the "Day of German Unity", the peace movement also recalls the 2+4 Treaty regulating the German question, on the basis of which Germany exists in its present form. There, the preamble lays down the German [politics](https://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/gesetze/zwei-plus-vier-vertrag/44112/praeambel "Zwei-plus-Vier-Vertrag") on these principles:

> " ... In accordance with its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations to develop friendly relations between nations based on respect for the principle of equality and self-determination of peoples and to take other appropriate measures to consolidate world peace, CONSIDERING the principles of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, RECOGNISING that these principles have established firm foundations for the establishment of a just and lasting peace order in Europe. RESOLVED to take into account the security interests of each, CONVINCED of the need to overcome contradictions definitively and to develop cooperation in Europe, REAFFIRMING their willingness to strengthen security, in particular through effective arms control, disarmament and confidence-building measures..."

The peace movement makes it clear that what is happening in the kalkar military site is contrary not only to the survival interests of the people of Europe, but also to international law.
