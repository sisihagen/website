"Neoliberalism in this form has come to an end," Klaus Schwab, the head of the World Economic Forum, now says in "[Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2020-09/corona-kapitalismus-rezession-wef-neoliberalismus-klaus-schwab "Der Neoliberalismus hat ausgedient")": "I am convinced that the entrepreneurial power of each individual is the driving force for real progress – and not the state. But this individual force must be embedded in a system of rules that prevents over-boreing in one direction or another. This function must be fulfilled by a strong state. The market alone does not solve any problems." He also considers a tax ingescost of millions of assets to be "socially justified." This means that Klaus Schwab is further than Chancellor Merkel or "back to work"-Friedrich Merz. 

But while even this guru of capitalism is now questioning neoliberalism and warning that social imbalances are continuing to increase and environmental degradation is continuing, we have governments and many mainstream media outlets on course. The nurses, bus drivers and garbage drivers, who have just been applauded for their indispensable (systemically important) efforts in the Corona crisis, should now be reluctant to hold back in the dispute over tariffs. "Already oblique: the epidemic is tearing billions of holes into the public coffers, members of the Bundestag are renouncing diet increases, pensioners have to reckon with a zero round in 2021, and the public service is growing strongly," laments Bild, after the German "truth medium" recently failed to get in to appreciate the achievements of these people. At the same time, Bild has no inhibitions to drum up for a new car purchase premium, for many tax millions to the car companies of the poor billionaire families Quandt, Klatten and Porsche, even though VW, Daimler and BMW have tens of billions on the high edge.

Perhaps the head of the World Economic Forum warns against unbridled capitalism, above all because he fears revolts otherwise. "If we do nothing about it, the changes will eventually come in a different way, through violent conflicts or revolutions, for example." Perhaps the horror went into his limbs when he read Albrecht Müller's new book "The Revolution is Due," which I can only recommend to everyone.
