A little more than 3½ years ago, the critical network reported on the journalistic online format [Jung & Naiv](https://www.jungundnaiv.de/ "Jung & Naiv") and its founder, the bright journalist Tilo Jung. In the meantime, its Interview Format has developed considerably and is now available in guessl. unintentionally also influence other German media representatives. Well done! Thanks to Tilo and the whole team.

Although the public-law institutions (such as ARD and ZDF are now also on Youtube, but especially the journalistic representatives of daily and weekly newspapers have noticed the possibilities offered by the World Wide Web. Instead of hiding articles and reports almost exclusively behind a Paywall, in order to delay the Creeping Death of the newspapers a little bit, one sets out on strange, new Terrain in the form of audio streams, so-called Podcasts.

#### Podcast – What is it anyway?

The term 'Podcast 'is a portmanteau of the terms' Broadcast 'and Apple's portable' MP3 player iPod', which dominated the market at the time of its creation. They are series-produced, subscribable media files that can be obtained automatically via a Web Feed (RSS) and belong to the Pull Media. In contrast to Push media (for example, newsletters that are actively sent by e-mail from the notifying service to the recipient's mailbox), the initiative for receiving messages for Web Feeds is entirely the recipient's. From subscribing to a web feed, he can decide for himself which messages he wants to retrieve and when.

The number of Smartphone users in Germany continues to grow and amounts to around 58 million in 2019, according to 'statista'. The so-called' smart mobile phones ' have become an important part of everyday life for many people. For most people, a life without it is not even conceivable anymore. What use and addictive behaviour can do to people in the context of progressive digitalisation has been critically analysed several times in other areas of the CN.

With the increasing advent of Smartphones, the MP3 Player established itself as an application (App), where it initially became more and more an all-rounder that played audio and visual formats by playing the favorite music. All-in-one Hand available when you need it, no matter where or when. Whether on the way to work, jogging or hiking, relaxing in the Park, travelling by Bus, train or plane. The Podcast is actually impossible to think away from today's media world.

The variety of topics seems unlimited. In addition to book recessions or Interviews, there are Podcasts on all topics. Fishing, professional football, politics, economy, Finance, Meditation, adult education, cooking, nutrition, General, history, biology, science, court reporting, crime report, baking, Knitting, grilling, and even to fall Asleep, there are Podcasts.

On the PC you also have the possibility to use various players (Podcatcher) to get even more out of your favorite Podcasts. Many good and serious podcasters produce so-called 'Shownotes' in addition to the 'audio track'. These are source lists and references from the topics covered and discussed. If an article is quoted, a book is offered as a reading tip or further information, this can be found in the 'Shownotes'.

There are also some podcasters that create a 'transcript' from their 'audio track' in order to be able to read the spoken words again in peace and quiet, undirected by image and sound. In addition, there are 'chapter marks', if different topics are covered and you want to listen to individual passages from the Podcast or use them again as a template.

{{< image srcwebp="/static/img/content/2020/213.webp" srcalt="/static/img/content/2020/213.jpg" title="The Internet makes journalism" >}}

The practical thing about podcatchers, however, is that you only enter the desired RSS Feed once and the desired Podcast then automatically updates itself with each new audio recording or each new episode to always be up to date. If you want to listen to older Podcast episodes, simply look into the archive and choose your desired episode. Awesome - right?

#### Information, but not as 0815 reporting

Now, of course, the question remains open, What does Tilo Jung have to do with all this?

Of course, only very limited in terms of the variety of Podcasts. But in the field of journalism you can already give him a kind of pioneering role. Remember his still current format Jung & Naiv, which he quickly converted to a Jung & Live due to Corona. For a few months now, the freelance Journalist has no longer been sitting with his interview partners 'vis-à-vis', but rather takes them on the screen via Webcam from the Home Office or his own living room and streams the interview series for all interested parties.

Depending on the guest and topic, his shows, which last between 60 and 120 minutes, enjoy different popularity. From regularly 20,000 viewers, Videos with some 'personalities' can even register up to 260,000 visitors. And it's no exaggeration to say Tilo Jung,"he had them all". Whether federal Economics Minister Peter Altmaier, federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, federal Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Josef Maas, federal health minister Jens Georg Spahn, the Economist Peter Bofinger, SPD chairman Saskia Esken or FDPlerin Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, Green chairman Robert Habeck, or the chairwoman of the left Katja Kipping.

In addition to all the" big guns from politics", however, other people from public life also come to his"Online Show". Actress Katja Riemann, tennis pro Andrea Petković, philosophers Richard David Precht, Svenja Flaßpöhler or Gerd Scobel, media scientist Bernhard Pörksen, chairman of the Supervisory Board of SV Werder Bremen Marco bode or virologist Hendrik Streeck. Everyone is naively engrossed in a conversation. And as always, everyone is "ducked".

Tilo Jung is a smart guy. He has long since recognized the signs of the times in terms of what his Community wants from him – first-hand information and not as processed uniform porridge, as we know it from the antiquated, aged TV. Jung's audience is not content with simple, pro-government, state-supporting and mass-compatible bungled news coverage. You want tangible people. People who really answer your questions, which you can send Tilo in advance of each broadcast by Email or ask live in the Chat while the broadcast is running.

In addition to the short-term Format from "Jung & naiv" to "Jung & Live", the Berlin Journalist is also noticeably developing further. With the episode a!After five years, the year-long discussion format "wake up Podcast" with Stefan Schulz and Hans Jessen will be rolled out on 21 July 2020. In addition to the thrice-weekly coverage of the federal press conference and The Associated short format "government diary", Jung is not content, however.

A new Format was also launched together with the literary scholar and film critic Wolfgang M. Schmitt. Under the name of "political analysis", Schmitt focuses on current topics and thrusts them up in an intellectual manner of the old style. And the Koblenz is really a dazzling, graceful appearance. Always linguistically correct, without phrases or slurs, but always accurate. Schmitt and der now and then saloppe Jung complement each other excellently when they ask the guests together in Jung & Live.

However, Jung also takes newcomers under his wing. Jenny Günther, a political scientist from Brandenburg, was one day a spectator at a public wake-up Podcast in front of an audience. When she took a seat on stage for her speech, she was already flirting with the idea of producing her own Podcast.

Tilo Jung and Stefan Schulz invited her to one of their other Podcast broadcasts and taught her technical expertise in the background. So it came to pass in January 2018 that Jenny put her first "meddling"Podcast on the net. Today, the Jüterbogerin looks back on more than 100 episodes. Günther deals only incidentally with the big political stage. Local politics is more important to her and so she also interviews District politicians, city treasurers or mayors at irregular intervals.

Wolfgang M. Schmitt, on the other hand, has his own Podcast In addition to co-hosting Jung & Live. Together with his production partner Ole nymoen, their weekly format "prosperity for all" is published, in which both talk about interrelationships in the financial sector and open up a critical view of Economic economic issues to the listener. They raise critical questions and try to explain them using examples. Whether it is about the history of neoliberalism, about the question of what social market economy really is, how Bitcoin works, how Inflation arises – all questions are illuminated and well explained here.

#### Turf radio: Journalistic view in a new Dimension.

Alongside Schmitt, sports journalist Max-Jacob Ost is a welcome co-presenter and guest on both the wake-up Podcast and the Jung & Live Format. His Expertise is particularly in demand when it comes to sporting topics, primarily football. With his own Podcast Format "Rasenfunk", Ost has earned an excellent reputation in the fan community, as his treatment of the respective match days in the Football Bundesliga pursue a particularly high quality standard.

But not only the game-day evaluations can Ost here to reminisce, but its very specific formats such as the "tribune interview" and the "short-pass", type the special value of his Podcasts again. In the "short-pass" can be taken a variety of current topics from the world of football under the microscope. The selected guest on the respective topic either comes from professional sports or is a specialist journalist. At the" Tribune discussion", on the other hand, topics are examined very intensively and elaborated extensively. Be it topics such as Football Leaks, the FIFA scandal around former President Josef Blatter or "blind and disabled" in the stadium.

Depression-a taboo subject that should not be one: "Depression in football: Sebastian Deisler, Robert Enke, Andreas Biermann, Babak Rafati, Markus Miller, Martin Amedick - they all stand for those active in football who have made their Depression public. There are a few other examples, but one thing stands out: in the coverage it is above all the extreme biographies that get attention with the tragic climax. Depression is a common disease that should be treated well. Under certain circumstances even in the running game Operation".

The Hillsborough disaster was a serious spectator disaster with 96 dead and 766 injured on 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. It occurred during the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest " two blocks behind the Liverpool goal are completely crowded, people are dying. From the beginning, the circumstances were veiled, the Fans were blamed. Even on the 30th anniversary of the tragedy, there are still open trials".

In several hours, the sports journalist Ost goes incredibly thoroughly into the depths and illuminates, better illuminated, every corner. Predicate: valuable! Just outstanding!

#### The themes are almost infinite

When it comes to Podcasts, you can't get past the names Holger Klein or Tim Pritlove. Both are regarded as pioneers of the Podcast scene and have been there since the beginnings of this type of media performance. The radio presenter and Journalist Holger Klein (photo below) himself has a whole Latte of produced Podcasts or is involved in further as a co-presenter.

Under the collective term "write" (wer redet ist nicht tot), Klein covers several topics. Together with the historian Matthias von Hellfeld (DLF-Nova), historical events from world history will be discussed at write history lessons. Sometimes you orient yourself on anniversaries, but sometimes also just on the topic itself. The relaxed and simple way also conveys historical connections to young listeners in an astonishingly simple way. This is how you would have wanted history lessons at school.

In write-Politikunterricht Klein has the social studies teacher Thomas Brandt from Bavaria as a guest and lets himself and his listeners explain politics. How does the EU work? What is an overhang mandate? How does the Federal constitutional court? In write - on the subject, Klein informs himself at irregular intervals or on current occasions with foreign correspondents, German emigrants or scholars about the events from the countries in which they live. Whether in France, Hungary, Russia, Brazil, the United Kingdom or the USA, 'Holgi' (as he is affectionately called by most) has a Person on each country and Topic who can report directly from the site. And this also extensively. Rarely, a Podcast episode lasts less than two hours, often longer.

Equally interesting and worth knowing is Klein's co-production with journalist Katrin Rönicke, who both speak strongly about weekly events in the world. Under the name "Wochendämmerung", both bring a wide variety of topics that they themselves move or which they find worth reporting. As a listener, you are very well prepared for the weekend, in order to be able to have a say in any debates at parties or in pubs. With the podcast" Resonator", Klein embarks on a scientific branch. In this series, which is supported by the' Helmholtz Association of German research centres ' (HELMHOLTZ for short), Klein interviews various scientists from various fields about their activities and the current state of research and technology.

Another veteran, Tim Pritlove (photo below), a German-British Event Manager and Podcaster from Berlin, is also producing a similar Podcast. In "spirit of research" is concerned Pritlove, with the 'Stifterverband für die deutsche Wissenschaft" (in short the Association), in which various scientists and their tasks are presented. He is producing another science Podcast called "Raumzeit", where he specifically interviews guests of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and has been reviving it since 2015 with the support of the Zeiss Planetarium in Berlin.

Like Holger Klein, Tim pritlove comes from the scene in and around the Chaos Computer Club (CCC). While Klein appears as a guest presenter at the annual convention of the CCC, Pritlove produces occasional Podcasts together with members of the CCC. Under the heading "UKW" (our little world) Pritlove deals in detail with the political Blogger and journalist John Worth about Brexit, with the statistician and former Pirate politician Pavel Mayer about the topic Corona. Furthermore, Pritlove produces the Podcast "Logbuch: Netzpolitik" with the Hacker, Internet activist and member of the CCC, Linus Neumann. The focus here is on data protection, decisions from the federal court in Karlsruhe, as well as German and European network policy.

There are also good Podcasts on the popular topic of 'Photography': The Photography Podcast: with their entertaining conversations around the topics of photography, Video and Design, Gil gropengießer and Julia Blumenthal report on their everyday lives as photographers. The Podcast is intended to encourage young photographers to believe in themselves and become self-employed. Every Thursday there is a new episode.

Coffee and Cameras, is the photography Podcast by Michael Damböck. In his 15-minute episodes, the artist and photo Coach is all about photo tips and Equipment. The Podcast is an interactive model in which Michael always responds to the questions of his listeners.

Happy Shooting: every week Boris Nienke and Chris Marquart provide exciting Input on everything that has to do with cameras and photography. From the professional full-format camera to the analog camera from the 80s, nothing remains on the track with this Podcast.

#### Print media discover the Podcast

Meanwhile, almost every major magazine or newspaper has its own Podcast, because the advantage contained in it is obvious. In the audio productions there are not only the' self-promotion ' but also the possibilities to point out columns, articles or reports, what future issues contain or if particularly important topics are to be examined again.

Sascha Lobo, for example, discusses the letters to the editor (e-Mails) on his column at Der Spiegel in the "Lobo – der Debatten Podcast". Business editor Corinna Budras and political editor Constantin van Lijnden of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) discuss current court rulings and new laws in their Podcast "FAZ Einspruch". The ZEIT editor – in-chief Sabine Rückert and her colleague Andreas Sentker, head of the science department, are revisiting old criminal cases and court cases in their Podcast "Zeit-Verbrechen". And the research Team of the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), Laura Teberl and Vinzent-Vitus Leitgeb, analyse the background and question the respective SZ authors about their articles.

A special feature is the Time Podcast "Alles gesagt". The editors-in-chief Christoph Amend and Jochen Wegner give their guests the decision as to when the Interview will end. Based on a keyword, which the guests from politics, media, Film and Sport determine themselves and then pronounce when the guest is of the opinion, everything is said. This results in a Format that seems to be infinite. Some episodes even reach a length of 8 hours and more. That such an unusual Format can also have its pitfalls was proved in the older episodes by guest Ulrich Wickert, who inadvertently uttered his keyword after only 12 minutes and abruptly ended the Interview.

#### Radio and television

The public broadcasters also produce their own Podcasts for their respective broadcasts. Especially the news flagships Tagesschau (ARD) and heute (ZDF) put the audio track of their news broadcasts as a Podcast on the net. One might think that the stations make it quite easy here, although it is proven that the linear programs on TV are consumed exclusively by the older audience (55+), while the non-linear Podcasts on the net are mainly used by the younger audience (30-).

What the long-established stations, whether TV or Radio, have not really internalized, however, is the temporal Format of their Podcasts. There is no time limit on the internet, because Podcast episodes are not subject to strict editorial direction. And yet, almost all providers offer formats that resemble a linear transmission sequence. Hardly any Podcast lasts longer than 15 minutes. In the net World, This is like a blink of an eye.

Podcasters in general usually have no time limit and do not curtail themselves of their possibilities. How often does an Interview turn out to be only an outline or a flyover, although the subject or Person would still have so many interesting aspects to offer, if you only give the guest 10 to 15 minutes of speaking time? Here, the stale and conservative media houses still have to learn a lot from the young.

So there are no talk rounds like Maischberger, will and Lanz with 4 or 5 guests in the formats. In the scene you take time for your interlocutors and the topic. It is also striking that many topics are accompanied with real professional competence, while in the linear broadcasts usually only political actors and clichéd Threshers get their say. And so it is not surprising that in the Podcast landscape real experts such as the social researcher Prof. Dr. Stefan Sell, the Cologne economist, poverty researcher and book author Prof. Dr. Christian Butterwegge, or the elite researcher Prof. Dr. Michael Hartmann speak extensively, while their Expertise is hardly to be seen at all in the coercive and advertising - financed talk shows.

The "Podcast" has become a constantly growing Medium in the media landscape. As with the print media and the public broadcasters, the Podcast Segment also includes providers from political camps with an ideological character/location, those with little or no useful value, but also some constructively critical representatives who convey a useful gain of knowledge. Well-known leading media from the print sector naturally operate in the new medium 'Podcast' a kind of acquisition to pick up dwindling regular customers and subscription readers, to keep or to generate new ones.

The political orientation of the respective print media is reflected in the topics and guests. In any case, one should not expect that a fashion magazine suddenly mutates into an investigative research Team and turns over the guidelines of its publishing house. However, if you take your time and browse through the diverse spectrum of the Podcast landscape in a self-thinking and above all quality-oriented way, you will quickly find what you are looking for and can compile your own information sources automatically and individually.
