The saying, ritually used for decades like an old tea bag, which is poured over and over again, has nothing to do with reality. It is a flat lie that belongs to the kind of lie that is said: If you tell a big lie and repeat it often enough, then it is also believed.

Have you ever noticed that there is usually no justification for this, certainly no comprehensible calculation of the alleged profit?

Maybe that would be a strong issue for a small request to the government ...

Presumably the answer would come from the reference to the fact that the German economy is dependent on exports and therefore benefits most from the common market, which can be clearly read from the export surplus compared to the other EU states. Of the total exports of 1,328 billion euros, 777 billion went to the EU states in 2019.

Yes, that's right. But there are several questions:

  1. who says that Germany's export performance to these countries would not have reached the same level without the EU and the Euro?

  2. Germany received only goods and services worth 631 billion from the EU states in the same year. This means that no comparable equivalent value has arrived in Germany for export services amounting to 146 billion euros. Why not?

  3. How do the economies that take our exports, but even less of us export, the money you pay for it?

  4. why, when looking at the median wealth of private households, does Germany rank so poorly within the EU?

  5. How does this fit in with the fact that Germany has the other euro states write "eternally" without ever demanding payment? There are now 935 billion on the table, which is called TARGET2 balance?

Since the Fifties of the 20th century, the Federal Republic of Germany had hardly been a strong exporting nation when the reconstruction of the war-torn cities and factories got underway, long before the annexation of the new federal states, with the German Mark as its currency. There was full employment and over a long time steadily growing prosperity.

In the Sixties and seventies the outdoor and indoor pools grew out of the ground like mushrooms. Cities and municipalities built proud new town halls and school buildings and decorated the inner cities with elaborately designed pedestrian zones. Country roads and motorways were built as on the assembly line and properly maintained. Trains and buses also ran on the flat Land (where today there are only disused stations and demolished tracks) with a satisfactory short cycle. Most families had enough income to live with two or three children.

The process of rapprochement of the European states, which began with the coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 and was extended as early as 1958 with the establishment of the customs union "EEC" (European Economic Community) and "EURATOM" (European Atomic Energy community) as a nuclear power promotion community, which led to the merger of the ECSC, EEC and EURATOM into the EC (European community) in 1967, actually brought prosperity to the member states.

But since the founding of the EU with the Treaties of Maastricht in 1993 and Lisbon in 2007, the creation of the institutions commission, council, parliament, the attempt to disempower the national parliaments, to supplant national legislation with EU law, thus to damage the democracy of the nation states and to replace it with democratically not legitimized persons and institutions, Germany, the former locomotive of the world economy, has become a heavily loaded pack-donkey, which has been forced to shit incessantly for everyone else.

If there is one thing we benefit most from, it is immigration, which we would not be able to enjoy without the open internal borders of the EU. All this went to the substance, and this can be seen everywhere.

What Germany, on its own, with the diligence and intelligence of the German population, had up to the Eighties established and built up of national wealth was converted into private wealth, and what could not be sold was given over to decay.

Anyone who can still remember Germany in the seventies and Eighties would never get the idea that Germany had benefited from the EU and the Euro. Even those who socialized in the GDR and joined the FRG in 1989 must be struck with blindness if they regard the remnants of what Germany was before Maastricht and Schengen and the monetary union as the crown of an exclusively EU-and Euro-based prosperity.

The most benefits? Not even "least lost" would be correct!

Housing shortage and horror rents, millions of unemployed – counted as well as not counted - an army of welfare recipients, the highest electricity prices, the lowest pensions (only Irish and Swedish pensioners are paid even more sparsely), school and university education broken, 5,000 out of 40,000 bridge structures in insufficient or insufficient condition, indoor pools were closed en masse, swimming lessons for pupils practically no longer take place, the railway continues to follow its timetables with broken doors and air conditioners – not to mention the state of the Bundeswehr.

It was all very different, and better. Much better.

But last year we were export world champion for the fourth time in a row!

Agree. Goods and services worth almost 300 billion dollars, we have given the world more than we have received from it. At least that's how the Ifo institute calculated it. In addition, as the EU's largest net contributor, we must not only finance the Brexit gap with a community contribution that rises by around 40%, and be liable for the EU's Corona aid programmes as well as for all previous euro rescue programmes, and must also watch the balance sheet of the ECB, of which we are the main shareholder, explode, because promissory notes of questionable value in the trillions are bought up.

Germany's Pride and joy?

One could also say that Germany was forgotten during decolonization.

And as long as the governors manage to maintain the Illusion of prosperity and the World Cup, as long as the people are shut off from the laughter of foreign countries by state radio and media, as long as we Germans really believe that we will benefit the most, so long will it remain so.
