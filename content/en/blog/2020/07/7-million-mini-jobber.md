More than seven million people in Germany were marginally employed at the beginning of the current economic crisis, working as Minijobbers. Already in March 2020, 224,000 of them were terminated from one day to the next. Although a notice period of six weeks applies to Minijobs, in most cases it has been deliberately ignored.

Minijobber were the first workers to be laid off in the new crisis, and there is no short-time work allowance for them either. Even the Minijob head office speaks of a‚Äù significant decline " and expects a second wave of redundancies in the coming weeks. Companies are now using the "flexibility through Minijobs" during the crisis to reduce staff quickly.

In 2003, the red-green government fundamentally reformed the mini-jobs to curb undeclared work in private households as cleaners or tutors, and they were to serve as a springboard into the first job market as a full-time employee.

Today, however, the Minijobbers are used less in the private household, but above all in the catering industry, in workshops and in health care. The goal of reducing undeclared work was also not achieved, despite the expansion of mini-jobs. At the beginning of 2020, more than seven million people in Germany were working as Minijobbers and the fairy tale of the springboard into the first job market is told again and again, so it does not come true.

Several companies have used the Minijob construct to replace their full-time jobs with several Minijobbers to be more flexible and many Minijobs are now replacing the former full-time employees. For the permanently employed cashier, three Minijobbers work or in the catering trade, three students Replace young people who have been working full-time for many years as waiters.

Minijobbers also have the advantage for companies that they do not organize themselves in trade unions and demand higher wages, they do not dare to strike or even to establish a works council.

Almost 4.4 million employees depend on the income from the mini-job because they have no other job than him, including many students, single parents and old people with low pensions.

Because the Minijobbers do not pay taxes, they also have no right to benefits such as unemployment or short - time work benefits. If, as now, you lose your employment, a few hundred thousand people immediately slip into HARTZ-4 or social code II / basic security.

More than 80 percent of the slightly paid Minijobbers can be exempted from the pension insurance obligation and thus waive their protection. In old age, these people are then dependent on the basic security according to the social code XII.

In companies with Minijobs, tax payments in the billions are bypassed. This is unfair because every employee with a lower and middle income who is working overtime, for example, has to pay full tax on it, while working in the mini-job is tax-free with the exception of a more symbolic flat tax.

In Minijobs, violations of the legally prescribed claims are still the order of the day. For example, about a third of employees do not include paid leave and almost as many have to forgo continued payment of wages in the event of illness.

For years, every wage increase or increase in the minimum wage has been demanded by the organized entrepreneurship to increase the 450 euro limit, because if in a mini-job more than 450 euro will earn, the employees must be employed subject to social security contributions. This is to be prevented in any case, because the exemption from the social insurance obligation makes this form of employment so attractive for entrepreneurs. Therefore, there is also trickery, e.g. by undermining the minimum wage, reducing working hours, charging work equipment and calculating tips so as not to exceed the 450 euro limit.

Minijobs prevent wage increases, displace regular jobs, promote old-age poverty and form a large part of the reserve army of workers during the crisis.

It is high time to finally abandon this working model.
