The US Administration has not missed an opportunity to make the life of the WikiLeaks founder a living hell. For years she has been waging a ruthless battle against Julian Assange. Even in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, the US secret services spied on Assange. Assange fled to the embassy in 2010 to avoid extradition to the USA.

At the end of June, the German-French cultural broadcaster Arte provided detailed information about Assange's spying in the report "[Grossbritannien: global Assange](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/097012-000-A/grossbritannien-global-assange/ "Großbritannien: Global Assange")". The two Arte journalists and filmmakers Étienne Huver and Marina Ladous have been researching the affair since March. They spoke to several people involved. Among them were Rafael Correa, the ex-president of Ecuador, Aitor Martinez, the Spanish lawyer Assange, Fidel Narváez, the former Ecuadorian consul in London and John Shipton, Assange's father.

As a reminder: last summer Julian Assange filed a criminal complaint in Madrid against David Morales, CEO of the Spanish security company UC Global. On behalf of the US intelligence services, Morales had spied on the WikiLeaks founder in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Meanwhile, the Spanish judiciary is conducting an investigation. As well as info Sperber, the Arte journalists have the Spanish court obtained documents.

#### UC Global employee: "I know everything about you"

In an Arte Interview with Assange's lawyer Aitor Martinez, one learns that the lawsuit has come about thanks to three ex-employees of UC Global: "I got a phone call. The caller said: You don't know me, but I know you very well. I know all about you. I recorded your conversations. I've been following you. I know everything you did in the message". Martinez was initially shocked by the practices of the Spanish security firm after speaking on the phone with the former UC Global employee.

The former employees of UC Global then sent Assange's lawyer a vast amount of documents. This included countless hours of Audio and video footage from the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Part of it is also info Sparrowhawk. This shows how UC Global had proceeded in monitoring Assange. Based on the documents and evidence, Martinez filed criminal charges against UC Global last summer.

Martinez was one of many who got caught in the sniffles. The Spanish security company, which according to the court documents was working on behalf of the CIA, was targeting the entire environment of Assange. However, they focused on Assange's lawyers.

#### Eleven times in handcuffs, placed

The Arte report also took up the ongoing negotiations on Assange's extradition to the USA. They started this February. The Arte journalists were also on site in London.

There, the current WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson gave an insight into how arbitrarily the proceedings against Assange are conducted. "Assange was led underground from the prison to the courtroom. He was stripped and searched twice. Handcuffed eleven times. When he returned to his cell, all his documents were confiscated. Including the documents for his defence, " Hrafnsson told the press outside the court in London.

But this was not all. During the trial, Assange was physically separated from his lawyers by a bulletproof glass case. As a result, he had trouble following the process acoustically. This was [reported](https://multipolar-magazin.de/artikel/der-prozess-gegen-julian-assange-tag-1 "Der Prozess gegen Julian Assange – Tag 1") by former British Diplomat Craig Murray, who followed the negotiations on the ground.

#### Assange's father: "you could have released Julian on bail"

On 11 April 2019, the British police arrested Assange. Since then, he has been held in the Belmarsh maximum security prison in London. The actions of the British authorities are unparalleled. Rafael Correa, former president of Ecuador, told Arte: "for the first time in history, a government allows a foreign power to enter its embassy to arrest a political refugee."

John Shipton, who also appears in the Arte report, describes the actions of the British authorities as "criminal". He is worried about his son's health. "We thought that the judge immediately set Assange free, like many other prisoners. Julian is only in custody. He is not condemned. He is not a danger to the general public. They could have released him on bail."The negotiations for Assange's extradition will continue in [September](https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2020-05/julian-assange-prozessbeginn-september-coronavirus "Anhörung im Assange-Prozess auf September verschoben").
