Hello, my name is Covid-19, but you probably know me by the name Coronavirus. Excuse me for my unsuspecting appearance, but it is not in my effort to let you know when I will appear, in what form and strength. Why am I here? Now... let's say I'm here because I was tired. I was tired of seeing you continually destroying yourself, I was tired of the way you treated this planet, how you treat each other. Your violence, your wars, your interpersonal conflicts, your prejudices. I was tired of your hypocrisy, your social envy, your selfishness. I was tired of seeing how little time you devote to yourself and your families. I was tired of seeing how little time you give your children. I was tired of seeing you constantly searching for the latest clothes, mobile phone and fastest car, just so you feel realized.
