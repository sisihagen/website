Pictures of empty shelves in supermarkets were a central motif of the media campaigns against Venezuela and other countries. These pictures are now also available from Germany. They are, of course, commented very differently than those from Venezuela, which were used by major Western media for calls for a coup. This experience can arm against future image campaigns.

In recent years, they have illustrated numerous distorting media reports: images of empty shelves in supermarkets in Venezuela. You can find a selection in the Google Image Search. These images were essential for the staging of the "starvation state of Venezuela", which despite its oil wealth could not provide for its people. Often the only seemingly innocent question of how "it could be" that the blessed Land falls into poverty was asked harshly. The answer: an "autocratic" government enriches itself and thereby "starves its own people". The reference to radical and illegal [economic sanctions](/static/downloads/IF10715.pdf "Venezuela: Overview of U.S. Sanctions") is often omitted: Western media then denounce the misery forced from the western side, without mentioning the causes. The causes are above all those sanctions, which many journalists themselves have secured in the media. Further media examples for these reductions will follow below.

#### A coup against "Hunger""

Of course, not all grievances in Venezuela can be blamed on the extensive sanctions regime that the Western world is directing against the country's socialist government. Conditions in Germany and Venezuela cannot be put on a par either. Deficits should not be relativized among themselves," Corona bottlenecks " may have to be considered separately. But: on the one hand, the grievances in the Latin American country are massively exaggerated in many major Western media for political reasons in order to create a reason for Intervention. On the other hand, at least to a large extent, the real supply shortages are actually the result of either Western sanctions or Sabotage by domestic [private-sector opponents](https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/08/11/venezuela-target-of-economic-warfare/ "Venezuela: Target of Economic Warfare") of the government.

The major geopolitical media campaigns (against Venezuela, for example) are not based on reality, but on the goal to be achieved. Because of this decoupling from the real events made possible by the power of the images and the shortening of the reporting, a very similar polemic campaign as that against the government of Venezuela could now have unfolded against the German federal government – or also against the government of the USA, where there are now similar images of the shortage. One could have asked harshly: "how can it be that the richest country in Europe runs out of flour and toilet paper?". This could have been used to build up accusations of corruption and demands for resignation, as well as calls for a coup, as can be found among many other major media outlets in the "Stern", which was headlined on the occasion of the supply situation in Venezuela:

> Is a military operation the last hope?

After all, it was now possible for weeks to document empty shelves in Germany's supermarkets. Our cover picture above shows a scene from Berlin on March 14th. And still on April 14, the following picture presented itself in Munich – an interested page would have had four weeks to take the photos out of context, to slaughter them and thus to portray Germany abroad as a poor state and the federal government as a failure, which had to be replaced in order to save "the people" from starvation.

One more word about the defamed "hamster purchases": I think you must not scare people first and then make fun of their stock purchases. Especially since this arrogance is always associated with alleged hypocrisy – which Journalist has probably refrained from serving flour and pasta himself in the last weeks? If the German media arrogance towards the self-sufficiency with toilet paper (and the dubious media focus on this product) has now already repelled, imagine that such a campaign would run against Germany and its government since 2013. Since that time, the shortage in Venezuela, which was also produced by the West, has been exploited once again with great complacency by large Western media. And because of the great defamation potential, it is probably not by chance often about a very specific product. Already in 2013, the " FAZ":

> Toilet paper for the Revolution

The Deutschlandfunk noted 2017:

> Rich land without flour, medicine and toilet paper

And the Portal web.de the headline still 2019:

> Venezuela: toilet paper and the Ruin of Caribbean socialism

As a recent example of a distorted and shortened coverage of the "crisis state of Venezuela", one can take the contribution of the" [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/venezuela-corona-101.html "Ein Krisenstaat kämpft gegen das Virus")": the article once again listed the consequences of the sanctions, without mentioning the sanctions themselves in a word – or the in the corona crisis [aid refused by the IMF](https://amerika21.de/2020/03/238325/iwf-venezuela-coronavirus "IWF verweigert Venezuela Hilfe gegen Corona-Pandemie"). Thus, the Western-initiated sanctions upheavals were indirectly blamed on the government of Venezuela. There are numerous other examples of how German media manipulate opinions!

#### Tools against image campaigns

The Version of the self-inflicted status of a failed starvation state is also narrated by international Western media, such as the British "Independent" in this [article](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/venezuela-crisis-food-inflation-refugees-life-people-maduro-a8762311.html "Venezuela crisis: Beyond the political drama, normal people are struggling to survive") or the US medium Bloomberg in this [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-23/what-s-worse-torture-or-starvation-venezuelans-to-answer-today "What’s Worse: Torture or Starvation? Venezuelans to Answer Today").

On the other hand, journalist Max Blumenthal demonstrated in this RT report or Abby Martin in this [Telesur report](https://www.resumen-english.org/2017/07/abby-martin-busts-open-myths-on-venezuelas-food-crisis-shelves-fully-stocked/ "Abby Martin Busts Open Myths on Venezuela’s Food Crisis: ‘Shelves Fully Stocked’") about the supply of supermarkets in Venezuela that pictures of empty shelves alone do not prove a Hunger epidemic. Many Germans are now also experiencing this: an empty shelf does not yet mean a state crisis. This experience can have some impact on future Western media image campaigns against recalcitrant governments.
