In Germany, we are daily filled with reports on the topic of Corona worldwide, without analyses and research, the opinions and statistics of others are published. Other voices and opinions are dismissed as conspiracy theory and of course FakeNews only come from Russia and China.

It is just thrown around with money where you should ask yourself How can that be. The infrastructure is crumbling, [bridges](https://www.structure-magazin.de/artikel/deutsche-bauindustrie-bruecken-in-deutschland-jetzt-schneller-sanieren-32707/ "Brücken in Deutschland jetzt schneller sanieren") are in danger of breaking down, roads are in a state that it would be more pleasant to drive on dirt roads, in [schools and universities must be invested billions](https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/schule/2018-08/sanierungsstau-schulen-toiletten-turnhallen-ferien "Rund 50 Milliarden Euro für Schulgebäude fehlen"), we are not talking about the low-wage sector, the unemployed, pensioners and public transport at all.

After a week of Lockdown, why ever Lockdown I go to work, for example, the corruption associations of industry and business come and shout around, bankruptcy wave, unemployed people and in general we will all be quite poor. The governments are putting together one package after another and no one is asking themselves the question, one week, Why are the companies already threatened by bankruptcy? No it gets distracted with statistics, with finger pointing at others and the word alternativlos makes the rounds once more. The rescue packages show once again that the capitalist system is not a winner, it is simply bankrupt.

There is also no talk about who will pay for the debt in the end. The economy demands tax relief and the complete abolition of the solidarity surcharge. So the state is supposed to feed the gang with loans, but it is supposed to curtail the income for loans. That sounds logical?

Apart from the whining, statistics, masks, ventilators and hamster purchases, the [Russian news agency Tass](https://tass.ru/opinions/8179197 "Каким будет мир после коронавируса?") once addressed the question of the after. I find an interesting point of view and translate the comment for you!

> Henry Kissinger believes that the current Covid-19 pandemic "will change the world order forever": "after the Coronavirus, the world will never be the same again," he writes in the Wall Street Journal, suggesting that even now, as the urgent tasks are tackled, the process of adaptation to the new world order will begin.

> "We are living through an epochal time," writes the former US Secretary of state and adviser to Presidents Nixon and Ford. "The historic challenge for the heads of state and government is to overcome the current crisis and at the same time build the future. Otherwise, the world could go up in flames."

> #### Do the government fulfill the trust of the people?

> Americans generally tend to exaggerate the importance and authority of their country as the master of the destiny of the world. Even the decisive Phase of their domestic baseball season they call "World Series". Their current President Donald Trump can confidently be called the world champion of Hyperbolization, which also applies to Kissinger, who is still in and out of the White House.

> The Patriarch of American geopolitics, who will be 97 years old in May, knows the weight of his words and says nothing recklessly. And the whole world is listening.

> For example, he underlines that the current economic crisis caused by the pandemic will be unprecedented in history. Accordingly, the "healing of the wounds of the world economy" seems to him no less important than the "strengthening of global resistance to infectious diseases".

> It is clear that Kissinger is particularly concerned about the fate of the "liberal world order" in which the United States has become accustomed to playing the leading role: "the democracies of the world must protect and uphold their values from the age of enlightenment," he writes. "A global retreat from the Balance between power and legitimacy will lead to the disintegration of social contracts, both at home and abroad."

> But then immediately comes a curious limitation: "however, this thousand-year-old question of legitimacy and power cannot be solved simultaneously with the attempt to overcome the plague of COVID-19. Restraint is needed on all sides, both in domestic political life and in international diplomacy. You have to set priorities."

> A key task for Kissinger is to "maintain public trust" in order to maintain "social solidarity, relations between societies and international peace and stability". So far, in his opinion, the US Administration is acting "solidly" and coping with the task of "preventing an immediate catastrophe".

> But "the most important Test will be whether the spread of the Virus can be stopped and then reversed in a way that preserves public confidence in the ability of Americans to guide themselves," warns the famous author. In his opinion, this is at stake: the credibility of the government, both in the United States and in "many countries" where "it seems after the pandemic that the institutions could not manage the crisis". By the way, people will judge not only their own governments, but also governments of other countries.

> #### "To whom I owe something, I forgive…"

> Kissinger explicitly does not mention any specific countries in his Text. And he does not recall, for example, that according to official data, the spread of the disease has already been largely stopped in China, and in Russia, too, the Situation is generally better than in the United States and Western Europe. And this despite the fact that he himself preached at the time to assess the state of strategic stability and security in the world in relation to relations in the "Triangle" of Washington – Moscow – Beijing.

> But no one really needs tips now. Everyone also knows what the Situation is like. Also, who really helps to fight the pandemic, and who expresses solidarity only in words.

> Against this background, the discussion about the "leadership role in the world" in the United States has recently not been without attacks against China. The tone is set by Trump and his secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, who publicly insist that the new Coronavirus should be called the "Chinese" or "Wuhan"Virus. Congressional lawmakers show ingenuity and call on China to allow an" international investigation "against China into the origins of the pandemic, which should then allow lawsuits against China to be filed in U.S. courts and then even force Beijing to write off" most of the American debt." The last idea of Congressman Jim Banks is, of course, strongly reminiscent of the Russian joke we all know in Russia: "to whom I owe something – I forgive…"

> Of course, all this is accompanied by a chorus of speculation that China, taking advantage of the pandemic, intends to rebuild the entire "world order" for its own benefit: "you must not reward the Chinese government by allowing it to play the role of hero in a crisis that it has created itself," wrote a commentator from The Hill newspaper.

> Another thing is that in the chorus of voices demanding to strike back against Beijing, respectful tones still resonate cautiously. For example, the political Portal "Real Clear Politics" has published a commentary by the Hong Kong-language newspaper "South China Morning Post" entitled "like it or not, but the crisis makes the Chinese government model shine." "China wins the propaganda war over the Coronavirus, "reported Politico. "Beijing is using Soft Power, while Europe and the United States are showing a lack of solidarity."

> #### Who is more flexible?

> In addition, many Americans under the "Chinese sauce" like to criticize their own, current government. The editor-in-chief of the online analysis platform "World Politics Review" insisted in his comment "why the Coronavirus pandemic will not lead to a new world order" that COVID-19 will not change anything fundamental, but only uncover and amplify the Trends that until now were only obvious to experts.

> "America's unwillingness to lead the globally coordinated response to this crisis should not surprise anyone under the current administration," the author writes. "President Trump has never concealed his contempt for multilateralism. On the contrary, he proudly proclaims that the United States no longer provides leadership to "shared prosperity" in crises."

> "More surprising is something else," the Analyst continues. "COVID-19 shows to what extent the unwillingness to lead became the bad quality of not being able to lead anymore. Trump has offered US aid to North Korea and later to Italy, France and Spain. But that was just Show. In fact, his government is so incompetent that it is not even able to provide full federal support to the states of its own country."

> Of course, everyone understands how bad this looks compared to China: "what Position will the United States and China take after the Coronavirus crisis, not only in terms of potential, but also in terms of the perception of the outside world about their ability to respond to a crisis wisely and decisively? Which System has potentially fatal, hidden weaknesses?"asked David Ignais, head of the foreign policy editorial office of the "Washington Post". And basically he gives the answer himself: "the authoritarian Chinese System has already turned the corner towards recovery. American democracy must show that a free society can do the same thing skillfully and quickly."

> #### "Through the prism of reparations"

> For Trump, this is also crucial because his prospects in the November elections depend on his success in the crisis. On Saturday, he reiterated that "medicine should have no worse consequences than the disease" and that "the country should be opened up to the economy". To achieve this, he is already thinking about creating a special Working Group in the White House. He is also publicly called upon by many supporters, although doctors beg not to hurry.

> The US economy needs to be revived anyway, but that's easier said than done. And it is impossible not to take into account the opinions of politicians and even ideologists.

> A simple example: young socialist Alexandra Ocasio-Cortes, a member of the US Congress from the state of New York, where there are many Corona cases, is already demanding "reparations" for the poor and minorities: "COVID mortality is disproportionately high among blacks and blacks of color," she wrote on Twitter, where she has 6 million followers. "Why? Due to the chronic effects of Segregation, of ecological racism, the gap between rich and poor and so on. All this inevitably affects health."

> "Inequality is a factor in mortality," concluded the US Congresswoman. "Measures against COVID should be planned through the prism of reparations."

> Similar views, though not so radical, are now expressed in America by many leftists, from young activists to gray-haired Nobel laureates. Even when no one had heard of the new Coronavirus, the debate on Socialism was one of the leitmotifs of the US presidential campaign. And I don't think this is a coincidence, especially since the re-evaluation of the values is not only going on overseas.

> #### All hope for the state

> "We are already witnessing a return to the ideology of the" Great government", which stands in stark contrast to the consensus of the last decades, "writes the former German vice chancellor and foreign minister Joschka Fischer on the website"Project Syndicate". "Everyone expects the state to pump huge sums of money into the economy and save (or nationalize) companies and industries that are considered vital and are now in danger. After the crisis, the greatly expanded role of the state will have to be curtailed, but how? The issue is controversial. Ideally, governments will use the proceeds of reprivatisation for people so that society has its own interest in regulation after the crisis."

> Referring to past experience, Fischer also points out that "such major shocks as the current one tend to shake the foundations of political systems and international relations. ( ... ) Western democracies in particular could be confronted with their system of government being called into question," he states. "Human rights principles can counteract economic imperatives. The pandemic has provoked conflicts between the young and the old Generation, and between authoritarianism and liberal democracy."

> In my opinion, this reflects Kissinger's warnings in somewhat more vague terms. At the same time, Fischer reminds us that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, it is not the elderly, such as Trump and his likely rival Joe Biden, who will have to contend with the long-term consequences of the crisis, but the generation of Ocasio-Cortes.

> #### Forcing humanity

> Ignais of the Washington Post believes that when analyzing the current Situation, the most interesting thing is not the devastating but potentially good consequences of the pandemic: "probably the next Generation in the US and China will be better prepared for disease outbreaks and other disasters," he writes. "Early warning systems, inventories, vaccines and supply chains will improve. Physicians will know more, their recommendations will enjoy great confidence."

> I also think that you can be grateful to the Virus for many things. And unlike my colleague from Washington, I do not associate this with the dispute between the US and China over global leadership and material factors.

> From my point of view-one can even say – the current crisis forces people to humanity. It reminds us that before illness and death we are all the same. It requires us to show the best human qualities: love, wisdom, mutual understanding, patience and compassion.

> It shows the destructiveness of selfishness and limits arbitrariness. It teaches us to take responsibility for ourselves and our actions, to consider the interests of others, to help others, even if only to get along at home under the conditions of quarantine.

> This destructive attack on our world reveals the limits of human intelligence and human capabilities. He curbs pride, teaches humility.

> It needs Social (actually antisocial) distance and thus reminds of the value of direct human communication without the help of Gadgets. He shows us how irreplaceable love, friendship, companionship and partnership. But he also teaches us the vital ability for every human being to be alone with himself.

> #### It works without wars

> In practice, the pandemic allows countries and peoples to check their willingness to respond to epidemiological threats under the most difficult "war"conditions. In this respect, it brings invaluable experience for the future.

> The most important part of prevention is forced self-isolation. By locking families in their homes, quarantine can help solve demographic problems. We are waiting for the "Coronavirus-Generation".

> The crisis is contributing to the modernisation of the economy and the whole way of life, an increasingly complete transition to digital technologies. It clearly shows us that many people do not have to go to work every day and waste time on their way to work.

> And finally, the geopolitical pandemic shows that the balance of power in the world can change without wars. Overall, it confirms that military solutions are not universal, it reduces the Prestige and importance of the factor of military force.

> What is happening, undermines all claims to exclusivity, Unipolarity and monopoly. It shows the true price of claims to"global leadership". International solidarity is needed in the face of a common threat. It demonstrates the lack of alternatives to genuine cooperation, even for those who are not willing to cooperate for various reasons.

> If there was no reason to think about all this, you would probably have to create it yourself. Maybe that was done.
