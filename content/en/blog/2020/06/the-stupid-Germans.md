In the German media you read a lot of accusations about Russia, 99.9% of them are just lies, but the summit is once again beaten by the [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/hacker-bundestag-111.html "Wie lief die Suche nach dem Hacker?"). The viewer must belong to the mentally imterirdisch equipped people. There is no other way to explain a Text that tells us that the" Hack " came to the Bundestag of Russia and the whole thing was solved by the USA.

Russia, of course, is following the German media and the Russian [Foreign Ministry](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4148999?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_cKNonkJE02Bw&_101_INSTANCE_cKNonkJE02Bw_languageId=en_GB#14 "Briefing by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, Moscow, June 4, 2020") has responded accordingly. By the way, the "evidence" was presented neither to readers nor to Russia. But it fits into the western, German image of the National Fascist and educational asshole!

> #### Germany’s accusations regarding Russia’s alleged complicity in a 2015 hacker attack on the German Bundestag

> We resolutely reject Germany’s groundless accusations against Russia concerning the complicity of Russian state agencies in a 2015 hacker attack on the German Bundestag.

> For all these years, Berlin has been circulating absolutely groundless speculations relating to an alleged Russian connection in hacking the German Parliament’s computer networks. As usual, they are talking about hacking, a ‘Russian connection’ and ‘Kremlin’s hand’. For all these years, Germany has been regularly exploiting this story as part of an aggressive anti-Russia media campaign, based on subtle hints and leaks quoting so-called “well-informed” anonymous sources in the German state machinery. The “highly likely” system is working. We are witnessing the use of a political approach aiming to persuade the German public to view Russia as an adversary.

> Here are the facts, rather than the “highly likely” scenario. Since 2015, the German side has failed to provide any evidence of Russia’s guilt and has also failed to coherently explain on what its anti-Russia accusations hinge. Repeated thunderous statements that no one, except Moscow, could perpetrate this cyber-attack because it is impossible to implement such an attack without using a special state resource are absurd. This amounts to a pseudo-legal position and nonsense. Today, German authorities are quoting certain “reliable evidence” that, according to the German media, was obtained by Berlin from the United States. This is an important aspect. The United States is a well-known supplier of “reliable” facts and evidence. If the German side really has received well-documented evidence of someone’s guilt from Washington, then the Russian side is ready to examine it. There are special mechanisms for exchanging the relevant data. At the same time, Moscow would unequivocally interpret failure to present facts as an unjustified anti-Russia accusation. What can be easier than providing this “reliable evidence?” In any event, we are not asking them to present eyewitnesses.

>Until now, Berlin has always failed to adequately respond to the Russian side’s repeated proposals to conduct a detailed discussion of German claims in connection with the hacker attack on the Bundestag during bilateral talks. In this connection, the German side has failed to send out any official messages and to make any inquiries or appeals via diplomatic channels or via the Russian National Coordinating Centre for Computer Incidents. By the way, we notified our German partners about the Centre’s existence and its activities.

> Moreover, we are extremely dismayed by Berlin’s position regarding overall Russian-German cooperation in the field of cybersecurity. In 2019-2020, the largest number of cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure facilities was perpetrated from Germany.

> In this connection, the Russian National Coordinating Centre for Computer Incidents has sent 75 appeals to German partners, and the Russian side has received replies only in seven cases.

> In 2014 and 2018, Berlin unilaterally torpedoed planned high-level inter-departmental Russian-German consultations on information security. It continues to consistently and purposefully shy away from resuming this useful cooperation format under various pretexts. But it would be possible to eliminate all issues, to provide information and to conduct talks under this format.

> All these statements considered, we are urging the German authorities to refrain from further escalating the situation and confrontationist rhetoric. We suggest renouncing threats that lead into a blind alley and to channel Russian-German dialogue on cybersecurity into an area of practical cooperation and real work.
