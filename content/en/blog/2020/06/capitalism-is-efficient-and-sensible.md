There is 1.5 times as much food on earth as would be enough for all humans. Nevertheless, nearly 10 percent of the population is starving. What should we think of an economic system that produces such results? "A child who dies of Hunger is murdered," said Jean Ziegler, Swiss sociologist, long-time UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food and then vice-president of the advisory committee of the UN Human Rights Council, in the opening speech at the 2011 Salzburg Festival. He was unloaded again. His statement would have been an understatement, because what he said about starving children applies to all who die without the need for it – people of all ages, through Hunger, war, because medicines are too expensive because of patents, because they lack an apartment. In addition, there are other aspects: four billion people would be easy to feed in addition, if not constantly huge amounts of food were fed to animals, which are still kept and killed mainly agonizingly. This, too, serves Profit above all else – and thus this small example alone shows that capitalism is neither efficient nor good for people.

Even his promises are deceptive, for the eternal compulsion to constantly transform everything into value and only use it to make even more Profit transforms even the best ideas and inventions into threats to man and nature. Technical progress should make life easier, take on heavy work and create new opportunities. This has also been successful – but instead of more joie de vivre, the lack of work has become a scourge. Technical feats do not help people, but optimize weapons of war, surveillance and exploitation.

Capitalist economy does not only subjugate man and suck out his forces wherever possible. He is just as predatory towards nature. Because the profit that companies want to achieve in this economic system, because they have to achieve it, is based on the maximum exploitation of the factors labor and nature, in addition to the advertising list, to induce potential buyers to consume too much and as expensive as possible.

Whether raw materials are sought and exploited, nuclear power plants or wind turbines are built, or services are offered – it is always about saving effort and money, in order to increase the profit margins. Taking into account the protection of the environment in terms of emissions, raw material consumption and Area selection costs money and time. Saving both increases competitiveness and profit margin. The resulting destruction of nature is disregarded as well as the ruin of human health or, as a repair operation, is generally paid for by society. Thus, reckless behavior against Man and nature is highly rational in the capitalist system and is rewarded with more profit and Expansion. Anyone who says no to this is dead in or as a company. A change in these constraints is not possible, often, and intensively attempted with little social indulgence to the acts or greenwashing, too. The economic system as such must be replaced.
