US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused China of restricting press freedom after three correspondents of the American "Wallstreet Journal" were stripped of their accreditation on Wednesday.

In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Gang Shuang asked on Thursday whether the discriminatory articles in the" Wallstreet Journals " against the Chinese Nation and the Chinese people are an expression of the so-called US press freedom?

Geng stressed that China legally regulates the affairs of foreign journalists in China. Those media, however, who insult China with their opinions or engage in racial discrimination, would have to expect serious consequences.
