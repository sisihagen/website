On January 24, the Syrian Arab army (SAA) resumed its Offensive in the northwestern province of Idlib. The ceasefire, which had been declared almost two weeks earlier by Russia and in consultation with Turkey, was broken by the jihadists in Idlib from the very first day.

For this reason, the bombing of the jihadist positions-i.e. non – civilian objects – by the Russian and Syrian air forces was resumed days earlier. Syria continuously informs the UN Security Council and the UN General Secretariat about the situation in Idlib. This time too, and as usual, the media consumer does not find out about it – but the usual lyre about a "humanitarian catastrophe”. It is the lyre of the perpetrators, the Sanctionists and terrorist supporters-those who have been responsible for an actual humanitarian catastrophe in Syria for nine years.

Below is the third letter that has been sent to the United Nations since the beginning of the year on behalf of the Syrian government.

> On behalf of my government and continuing our previous letters regarding proven crimes committed by armed terrorist groups, I would like to draw your attention once again to the following.

> Whenever the Syrian Arab Army makes progress against terrorist groups anywhere in the Syrian Arab Republic, those states that support terrorism inevitably launch a feverish propaganda campaign aimed at diverting attention from the terrorism, Aggression and occupation to which the country is subjected.

> These activities of those states confirm that they have never had any real interest in protecting the lives of civilians. On the contrary, their primary concern is to protect their investments in terrorism, in which they have invested tens of billions of Dollars. In this context, the Syrian Arab Republic wishes to recall the suffering inflicted on the civilian population by the activities of armed terrorist groups, which have sown death and destruction wherever they have operated in the past nine years.

> They have used civilians as human shields, misused hospitals and schools by converting them into military bases, and subjected residential areas to indiscriminate shell and rocket fire. Their crimes continue unabated. Armed terrorist groups concentrated in Aleppo province and elsewhere have recently stepped up their attacks on densely populated and so far safe districts of Aleppo, shelling them with grenades and rockets, killing and wounding dozens of civilians, mainly women and children.

> In order to combat these crimes and as part of its determined efforts to protect the lives of innocent civilians detained in terrorist areas, the Syrian Arab Republic has taken a number of measures to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches them on the one hand and to guarantee their safe and unhindered exit from these areas on the other.

> However, these actions were answered by armed groups in the area of Aleppo and the city of Idlib with terrorism. At the direction of their commanders, they continue their attacks on civilians. They refuse civilians to leave the areas and continue to hold them hostage to use as human shields. They fired at people who decided to flee in the direction of Abu al-Duhur, Habit and Hadir through humanitarian corridors set up by the Syrian Arab Republic to allow the passage of civilians.

> The government of the Syrian Arab Republic will spare no effort to rescue civilians and get them out of terrorist-held areas. Their military operations and attacks in the terrorist areas target the sources of shelling and are in response to repeated criminal attacks on innocent civilians by terrorist gangs. 

> The government of the Syrian Arab Republic will continue to do everything in its power to fulfil its constitutional and legal duty to fight terrorism and to free Syrians from the scourge and machinations of armed terrorist groups. It will continue to do so in accordance with the principles of international law and the UN Security Council resolutions on combating terrorism, as Will any other state that is seriously committed to its independence and sovereignty within the United Nations.

> I would be grateful if this letter is issued and distributed as a Security Council document.

> Signature Bashar al-Jaafari

> Permanent Ambassador of Syria to the United Nations

Finally, some information on the current situation in Syria, without any claim to completeness.

Once again, a Syrian oil Pipeline near the port city of Banyas in the shallow waters of the Mediterranean coast was heavily damaged by IEDs. This correlates with the [oil embargo](https://southfront.org/syrias-offshore-oil-pipeline-came-under-attack-amid-fierce-clashes-in-idlib/ "SYRIA’S OFFSHORE OIL PIPELINE CAME UNDER ATTACK AMID FIERCE CLASHES IN IDLIB") to which Syria has been subjected for years by the Western community of values.

The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) Offensive in Idlib, which resumed on January 24, was the direct result of a multi-stage attack by hundreds of Islamists on SAA positions, resulting in heavy casualties.  Russian [sources](https://southfront.org/dozens-of-syrian-army-troops-reportedly-killed-wounded-in-idlib-whats-going-on/ "SYRIAN ARMY REPORTEDLY SUFFERS HUGE CASUALTIES IN IDLIB. WHAT’S GOING ON?") report over 40 dead and 80 wounded Syrian soldiers. For those who trust Western Propaganda that the war in Idlib is directed against the civilian population, this can give cause for reflection.

As part of the Offensive, the Syrian army leadership announced on January 29 that the second largest city in Idlib province, Maarat al-Numan, and more than a dozen other [villages](https://www.sana.sy/en/?p=183697 "Army liberates Ma’aret al-Nu’aman city, 28 villages and towns in Idleb southern countryside, Army Command says") had been liberated by the Islamist extremists.  The ARD-Tagesschau is still holding back, but other large mass media like to pass on Reuters reports, which sell this Offensive as Terror against the civilian population.

The consumer does not know about the fact that previously humanitarian [corridors](https://www.sana.sy/en/?p=183029 "Terrorists continue preventing civilians from leaving through corridors in Idleb and Aleppo countryside for 8th day") had been deliberately attacked by the "rebels” and here calculates a politically exploitable Situation is brought about, which forces [civilians] to take an escape route towards the Turkish border.

There are increasing signs that another false Flag Operation is being prepared to choke off the SAA Offensive. With Turkish support and once again with the involvement of the White Helmets, they are planning a chemical weapons attack that they want to blame on Syria. The False Flags are supposed to take place in precisely those areas where the rule of the al-Qaida militias is most threatened. This is on the one hand the area west of Aleppo and on the other hand the southeast of Idlib. Syria has informed the United Nations of these plans.

Due to the rapid advance of the SAA in the south of the province, the danger for such an action there is probably banished. But in western Aleppo, where the Turkish border is closer and the presence of militias, Turkish military and various intelligence services is certainly greater, the danger of a False Flag must continue to be seen as realistic.

Syria has a huge foreign exchange problem. As it has been decoupled from the international financial market in the US dollar and euro area by Western sanctions, there is a steady speculative depreciation of the Syrian pound against these [currencies](https://www.sana.sy/en/?p=183539 "Foreign Ministry: Terrorists working to fabricate chemical attack with support of Turkey"). Because foreign exchange trading companies licensed in Syria appear to be involved in these speculations, the Syrian Central Bank has ordered 14 of them to be closed by April 30 of this year and also to reassess their benefits to the Syrian economy. 

Since the beginning of the war, the price of the Syrian pound against the US Dollar has fallen from 50:1 to 1,200:1. However ,this is the [black market rate](https://www.sana.sy/en/?p=183108 "CBS shuts down a number of currency exchange companies"), the rate issued by the central bank is 443:1. it is suspected that a number of private businessmen within the foreign exchange trading companies are making a cut with this price difference, thus adding further damage to the Syrian economy, while they are suppressing the central bank's urgently needed foreign exchange.

The Syrian government has now adopted draconian measures against illegal [currency transactions](https://sana.sy/en/?p=182908 "Presidential decree forbids the use of anything other than SP as payment means") to prevent this and the establishment of a shadow currency (US Dollar) in Syria's domestic economy. Syria's financial crisis was exacerbated by the [banking crisis](https://www.sana.sy/en/?p=183024 "Individuals arrested for unlicensed currency exchange and money transfer") in neighbouring Lebanon. There, the banks have reduced the issue of banknotes extremely. Lebanon was one of the few sources through which Syria still had limited access to Western foreign exchange. The economic war against Syria includes a financial war and it shows how dependent Syria is still on the US dollar System.

Since 30 September 2015, more than 1.3 million Syrian domestic refugees and 767,000 [refugees](http://syria.mil.ru/peacemaking_en/info/news/more.htm?id=12273058@egNews "Bulletin of the Centre for Reconciliation of Opposing Sides and Refugee Migration Monitoring in Syrian Arab Republic") have returned to their Syrian homeland from abroad. In Germany, there are at least 170,000 Syrians ready to return, who are merely waiting for the opportunity to leave.
