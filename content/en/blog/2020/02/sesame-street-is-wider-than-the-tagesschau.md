While in the children's program the successful series Sesame Street for children in preschool age already since January 1973 bravely after the " WHO? How? What? How come? Why?"even after the" why " is asked, the Tagesschau is silent ironically, where questions are urgently needed. A typical example is the affair around "CRYPTO AG", a shop that was bought by the German federal intelligence service BND and the US CIA in 1970 and controlled by Siemens AG.

Although the ARD news program reported under the headline "a unique scandal" about the fact that the Secret Service Company had been exposed, but otherwise wrapped itself in silence. Even the million-dollar profits were reported. In the meantime, the governmental broadcast had to report on the black coffers of the BND, too, after it seemed to know nothing for years. But the necessary questions were not asked at the latest.

A classic question would have been the one about the taxation of money, because only in this way one could get to the track of the mafia - like circumstances of the lousy wiretapping affair. But the Hamburg editors remain silent. "Who? How? What? How come? Why? Why? Who does not ask remains stupid " knows to sing the children's song, at the same time Motto and title song of the Sesame Street, and who now means the ARD-Radakteure, knows only half the truth. Above all, the spectators, who are left in the dark about the surrounding area, are supposed to remain stupid.

The " WHO? How? What? How come? Why? Why?"once again, no research is done, because an essential virtue of journalism, to ask good questions about enlightenment, does not seem to know the Hamburg cucumber troupe. The chancellery could have been asked - and should have been asked; also the question to the criminal justice, when those responsible go to jail, who together with the US authorities have spied on the German citizens for decades.

Instead of asking tough questions about the role of Turkey, Tagesschau tells about a so-called "rebel stronghold" in Syria. Here, the Wording, the use of language, alters the right questions. Because what is so romantically called "rebels" is nothing else than the camouflage name for Khan al-Assal, mercenary of the emirate of Caucasus or the Islamist party of Turkestan. These terrorist groups belong to the units around the Syrian town of Idlib.

In this area, the Turkish army is launching an Offensive and threatening "retaliatory strikes". Now, interesting questions should be asked of the German Foreign and Defense Ministry, for example: what is Germany's relationship with NATO Partner Turkey, which is contributing to the expansion of the war in Syria? But the Tagesschau editorial board does not ask the questions, which would also raise the question of what Germany actually does in NATO and how long it wants to remain in this aggressive military alliance?

Everyone thinks that now finally comes the journalistic question, because under the heading "advice on Nazi victim groups-finally recognition for enormous suffering" the Tagesschau notices that the unemployed and homeless also became victims of the Nazi regime and were deported to the concentration camps.

But consistently, as for more than 70 years the Soviet prisoners of war do not exist in the German public. Since the Tagesschau also does not want to follow up. Of the 5.7 million 3.3 million were destroyed by work and Hunger. The Tagesschau doesn't even dare to ask the question where the memories of the camps are. They existed all over the country, but to this day almost nothing reminds us of the German killing machines to which the peoples of the Soviet Union fell victim.

The silence also weighs on the ARD like a coffin lid.

Ralf Borchard from Bayerischer Rundfunk, who has been working since Sept. 2012 delivered Audio reports from Vienna to the editorial offices in the ARD stations from all over South-Eastern Europe, he becomes quite talkative when he agitates in a commentary of 16 February:"foreign policy Germany must not duck away any more". What Burchard hardly disguised says: the Germans should do more to prepare for war. Here, power-at-eight asks the long-overdue questions:

  - How long may such war drummers still beat the drum of Public Service Broadcasting?

  - Who allowed the man to ignore the peace commandment of the basic law?

  - Which branch of the arms industry pays for Propaganda?

All questions that many viewers ask themselves and to which they get no answer.
