Russia is ready to end communication with the European Union for some time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. This official end to Russia's patience with racist prejudice and anti-Russian propaganda comes as no surprise and is troubling. The two countries would benefit from a rapprochement, but this rapprochement has been torpedoed for decades by transatlantic trolls such as Merz, Röttgen and Maas.

The words of the Russian Foreign Minister [Sergei Lavrov](https://de.sputniknews.com/politik/20201013328151463-lawrow-schliesst-stopp-von-dialog-zwischen-russland-und-eu-nicht-aus/ "Lawrow schließt Stopp von Dialog zwischen Russland und EU nicht aus") on Tuesday are not surprising: Russia has for years endured with great patience the unilateral attacks of Western propagandists without responding adequately. But at some point the moment had to be reached when the barrel overflowed. If the outstretched Hand is knocked out again and again, then even a Diplomat like Lavrov must find out at some point:

> "Then it should be so, if you want that."

Despite the consistency and the expectation of the Russian reaction, Lavrov's clear words are also a bang – for the same reasons: in the West, people had finally become accustomed to being able to pour unproven accusations on Russia at will, without this leading to consequences for the anti-Russian mood makers.

#### The determination of the transatlantic

Now these expected consequences have also been officially and clearly formulated by the Russian side – and this development affects not only the responsible propagandists and splitters, but the whole of Germany, the whole EU. It has to be described as tragic how a group of determined transatlantic politicians and media manage to sacrifice the chances of German-Russian détente for short – term successes-such as the stop of Nord Stream 2-and thereby endanger the future of all of us.

Both Germany and Russia are not free from political deficits – in this respect, both sides should be very cautious with moral reproaches. There is also no question that both countries would benefit greatly from rapprochement and détente: at the economic, cultural and peace levels. This approach must take place.

#### Germany leading anti-Russian Propaganda

And even if one were to share the anti-Russian resentments of the major German media, one would have to describe the massive attacks of the West against the current government of Russia as at least short-sighted: it is quite possible that a government following current Russian President Vladimir Putin could be considerably more radical and nationalistic.

It is shameful that Germany plays a leading role in the current campaigns against the Russian government and thus offends Russian sympathies for Germany just as brusquely as it betrays Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.

#### Lavrov's "political bomb"

Although a Russian reaction to the long-standing and one-sided attacks of the West was long overdue, there is now a certain drama associated with Lavrov's appearance: one has the very disturbing feeling that a border has now been crossed. The Blog "Anti-Spiegel" even classifies the process as a "political bomb" :

> "If you consider that the Russian government has been very critical of the US over the last five years, but has exercised great restraint towards the EU in order not to break off the bridges with its European neighbours, then the new sounds from Moscow are a political bombshell. So far, despite all the European sanctions and the ongoing anti-Russian rhetoric from Europe, Moscow has even reacted with understanding, because it was well understood in Moscow that this was done under pressure from the United States."

Lavrov describes how a determined transatlantic group is enforcing a policy in the EU that is directed against the interests of the EU:

> "Even the instinct to secure one's own interests must persuade Europe, which is united in the EU, to partner with Russia and to cooperate with Russia. In my opinion ( ... ) for the time being, the European Union is unable to cope with the Russophobic minority, which speculates on the principle of consensus, on the principle of solidarity and blocks more or less constructive approaches to the development of relations with Russia."

#### Media turn reality on its head

Many German media ignore the important process. For those who speak out, the reaction varies between recklessness and hypocrisy. And, of course, the editors, who have also disrupted the German-Russian relationship, now want to de-dramatize the Situation in order to reduce their own responsibility for a dangerous escalation. For this, reality is turned upside down – in the "FAZ", for example, irresponsible recklessness is combined with false accusations of guilt:

> "It was the Russian policy that forced the Europeans to strike a hard tone towards Moscow. The fact that foreign minister Lavrov reacted harshly to this is not too bad."

Reality also ignores an article in the" Welt", which now wants to push Russia into the role of the conversation-denier, although it was the West, which has blocked numerous German-Russian channels:"Russia says Njet again". So it is "Russia's boycott of talks" that is now slowing down diplomacy. The solution is simple: in order to escape from the moral spell of the West, Russia would simply have to make a "new policy" :

> "Solving Russia's problems differently than with Novichok, pistols and Njet would make sanctions superfluous."
