Historical ignorance cannot be. Too much was written about the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau 75 years ago in the days before 23 January 2020. [But Ursula von der Leyen faked](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_90 "Joint Statement by President von der Leyen, President Michel, President Sassoli ahead of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau") in a "Joint Declaration by President Ursula von der Leyen and Presidents Charles Michel and David Sassoli in the run-up to the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau"" literally: "75 years ago, the Allies liberated the concentration and extermination camp. In doing so, they ended the most horrific crime in European history, the planned extermination of the Jews in Europe. Six million Jewish children, women and men have been murdered, and with them millions of other innocent people, including hundreds of thousands of Roma, who have faced persecution because of their ethnicity. The price was unspeakably high, but hardly a triumph over the Nazis could be greater and more symbolic than to celebrate this 75th anniversary of liberation in Israel."

The "price was unspeakably high", but those who paid it, this "unspeakably high price", is concealed – no, is deliberately incorrectly stated.

It was, if I may say so, not "the Allies" who liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, but the soldiers of the Red Army – and the victims, the "unspeakably high price", were the soldiers of the Red Army. Churchill had explicitly and in writing asked Stalin in January 1945 not to let up in the fight against the Hitler troops, because his own troops doubted that he could successfully advance against the Hitler troops on the Western Front if Hitler had been able to move troops from the Eastern Front to the Western Front.

But von der Leyen is not alone. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted unreservedly to The Holocaust at the commemoration ceremony in Jerusalem on 23 January, but even at the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, he did not manage to mention the soldiers of the Red Army who had made it.

Us Vice President Mike Pence went even further. He mentioned "the soldiers" who liberated the extermination camp, without mentioning which soldiers were there. Later in his speech, however, it was "the American soldiers" who suffered in the fight against the Hitler troops.

#### And how did the NZZ report?

The NZZ has also made a real minnow in this regard. The long-time proven Middle East correspondent Inga Rogg wrote a detailed report on the 5th "World Holocaust Forum" from Jerusalem, where she is now the new correspondent in place of Ulrich Schmid. This report was even on the front of the NZZ on 24 January. It contained the following sentences: "There is a lot of room in the Russian representation, on the other hand, for the accusations to Warsaw that it had collaborated with the Nazis. Official Poland, on the other hand, wants little to know about this dark side of its history. Two years ago, Warsaw even tried to criminalize accusations of collaboration." Inga Rogg's report was also available on NZZ-online. There, however, this passage was changed: "There is a lot of room in the Russian representation, on the other hand, accusations against numerous Poles for having collaborated with the Nazis. Official Poland, on the other hand, wants little to know about the dark side of its history, that at that time some Poles actually took part in the persecution of Jews. The government in Warsaw portrays Poland and its people exclusively as heroic resistance fighters or victims – the Polish perpetrators are a taboo subject. Two years ago, Warsaw even tried to criminalize unfounded collaboration allegations."

On this change, the editorial board noted: "An earlier version of this text contained a phrase that gave the impression that Warsaw had collaborated with the Nazis. That's wrong. But there were also Poles who handed jews over to the German occupiers, whether for fear, lack of money or anti-Semitism."

It is a pity that the NZZ editorial team did not mention who asked for this rewording to 'some Poles'. Did "Warsaw" even respond?

It must not be true that the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp was liberated by Red Army soldiers. The criminals lie while the ass-extinguishers murder!
