Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is who again: for a time he was considered a dictator in the EU and its German heartland. Then, in March 2018, he concluded the refugee deal with the EU: the Turkish state is preventing people fleeing war and Hunger who want to reach the European Union via Turkey from continuing to flee. There is money for this and above all recognition from the EU.

At the latest since this agreement, the Turkish ruler regularly threatens with the refugee weapon if he likes it: be nice to me, Erdoğan says, otherwise I will let the refugees cross the border unhindered.

The dirty deal from March 2018 has an imperial footnote in addition to warding off refugees. The EU and Turkey are working together "to promote full and unhindered humanitarian access throughout Syria."Anyone who wanted to help the Syrians achieve more humanity would have to end the war in their country. He would have to talk to the Syrian government about humanitarian measures. But whoever, like the EU and Turkey, demands and agrees on "unhindered access" to a foreign territory, ignores the sovereignty of this state, wants to play his game according to his rules in an area in which he has no business under international law.

Assad must go! With this slogan, since the beginning of the civil war in 2011, a conglomerate of different foreign forces has been operating in and around Syria in order to get the Syrian Arab Republic under foreign control. The conference of the German "Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik" (SWP), an extended arm of the chancellery, served this illegal interference in the internal affairs of another country under the title "the Day after", which formed the Syrian Opposition to the fight against Syrian President Bashar Hafiz al-Assad. Even those who believe the Assad label "dictator" are faced with two questions:

  - Where and how is the overthrow of governments from outside legitimized in international law?

  - Why, for example, are the Saudi dictatorship or the Egyptian military dictatorship not on the Western Agenda for a system change?

At the beginning of 2017, the G-7 countries also demanded, as a matter of course, "Assad must go". Anyone who can remember the beginning of the Iraq War knows what it means when the US repeatedly accuses the Syrian government of using the poisonous chlorine gas without proof: it legitimizes illegal interference in Syria and justifies a possible warlike Invasion of a country that has neither attacked nor threatened the US. Erdoğan, the US scholar, claims that his troops recently destroyed a chemical weapons facility near Idlib. And from the TAGESSCHAU to Der SPIEGEL to "T-online", German media proclaim this claim without recalling the fake poison weapons justification of the US for the Iraq War.

The deliberately blind leading media may not establish a connection between the refugees and the anti-Assad war willed for the sake of values. The fact that Erdoğan, whose territory is now home to 3.6 million Syrian refugees, produces most of the refugees himself and then uses them as a weapon against the EU is something the ordinary editor simply cannot see, since he would have to pull his head out of the warm butt of the authorities and expose himself to the cold Wind of reality.

Instead, as is usually the case when media realities have serious gaps in explanation, the Russian is somehow held responsible. Almost optimally follows the well-frequented network appearance "web.de "this line and fabricated, without a hint of proof,"refugee crisis - Putin is at the same time beneficiary and Causer". The fact that the owner of this folly instrument, Ralph Dommermuth, has a fortune of 5.9 billion dollars and is thus one of the 300 richest people in the world and has already donated 500,000 euros to the CDU, who knows? Who wants to know that billionaires have their own private truth.

In a parliamentary debate, the CDU has blamed Russia for the "escalation of the security situation in Idlib", and the Greens have promptly demanded further sanctions against Moscow. Although the Russians are currently earnestly and honorably striving for a ceasefire around Idlib in order to at least get close to a peace, faded media tell how time "hundreds of thousands of people are currently fleeing the Syrian and Russian attacks towards the Turkish border." The fact that this war is caused and operated by completely different forces disappears behind the romantic term "rebels". It would be brave rebels who would fight against Assad and the Russians.

These "rebels" are all Islamist terrorists fighting the secular state of Syria. The same people who loudly warn against Islamist Terror like to make themselves accomplices of sinister Sharia bandits in the case of Syria. It is precisely these gangs that have been waging a cruel war for years and days, allowing people to flee Syria. And anyone who lets them appear in the media in camouflage suits as "rebels" is complicit in this war: through conscious confusion of concepts.

Erdoğan's refugee weapon is not just a means of blackmail. It is also a heavy weapon against that Western order which is supposedly so bravely defended by politicians and editors of the "middle". It is this weapon that is used by groups such as the AfD against the traditional parties. Because it is precisely from this centre that the causes of flight are consistently concealed, any nationalist nonsense about the role of refugees can be told, and the suffering Syrians, when they cross the borders of the EU, become ammunition against the structures of their host states.

"The day after can become the day after" of Merkel, Seehofer and Lindner. Only the Dommermuths will survive this system correction, whose system simply integrates the refugees as users in the 1&1 communication or as low-wage workers in their Call centers.
