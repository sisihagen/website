1. in order to let [ZDF viewers](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute-journal/heute-journal-vom-24-03-2020-102.html "heute journal vom 24.03.2020") know right away, the news that China is opening Hubei province is marked with the accent right at the beginning: "Beijing's Propaganda". Even in these critical times, the anti-communist fighters of today's Journal with Claus Kleber at the helm cannot do without such campaign journalism. Accordingly, Claus Kleber goes to the point: he criticizes China for weeks of hesitation and suppression of the truth. Does Claus Kleber apply this critical attitude to the German health minister Spahn? In this country, there was Hesitation. - And then comes minutes of system comparison and haggling about China. Of course, peppered with words like Regime. "Sealed off by all means of an authoritarian state". China places the good of the community above the freedom of the individual. Etc.

Take a look at the first 4:16 minutes of this piece from the kitchen of today's Journal. It is a convincing document that we have a strong campaign journalism and that important media still remain in the trenches of the Cold War, now also in the fight against China and no longer only against the Russians.


2. from Minute 5:00 on, the [moderator compares the Situation](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute-journal/heute-journal-vom-23-03-2020-102.html "heute journal vom 23.03.2020") with other countries that are " on the Limit "and thinks that the German government" draws from the full", and it assures that it can,"after years of good economics".

Here, the austerity policy is justified and, of course, not a word is said about what this austerity policy meant for the infrastructure, namely that it is ailing for a long time. And not a word about the effect of austerity on the health system – namely, without sufficient reserves. Even masks to protect against infection and the spread of the disease are missing in this country. We impose an export ban. Spain is partly supplied by China.

One has to assume that these admissions to ZDF and its Moderator do not fall by chance, but rather aim not to come to "stupid thoughts" in the time after that – for example, to reconsider the privatization of hospitals, or to demand better wages and salaries for nursing staff, or, for example, to abandon the doctrine of debt brake.

3. On another occasion I have already drawn attention to the following article by the Berliner [Tagesspiegel](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/deutschland-in-der-coronakrise-warum-wir-schroeder-und-merkel-dankbar-sein-muessen/25675874.html "Warum wir Schröder und Merkel dankbar sein müssen"). I quote the relevant title and introduction:

> Why we must be grateful to Schröder and Merkel

> The reform Chancellor and the savings Chancellor have made Germany sound. This pays off in the corona crisis. comment.

> History judges people most justly. Only when many years have passed does it turn out who was a fool – and who promoted the good. These days, the Bundestag will adopt a supplementary budget of 156 billion euros, of which 122.5 billion euros will go into financial injections, loans and grants for Coronavirus sufferers. It is the largest [aid package](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/wie-die-bundesregierung-die-wirtschaft-stuetzen-will-scholz-persoenlicher-whatever-it-takes-moment/25642184.html "Scholz' persönlicher \"Whatever it takes\"-Moment") ever adopted in Germany.

> It is too early to judge the benefits and disadvantages of this package. But it is not too early to shed light on the conditions that make it possible. The German economy is solid, unemployment is low, until recently tax revenues were bubbling up, and the budget managed without new debt. This has two main causes: on the one hand the Agenda 2010 reforms of the Schröder government, on the other hand the strict austerity measures of the Merkel governments.

Here, too, it remains to be noted that this comment obviously aims to prevent a different policy from Schröder's Agenda 2010 and Angela Merkel's and Schäuble's austerity policies in the future.

You should keep an eye on these targeted and planned media events before you are too inclined to see and paint the chances of a different kind of politics and a different spirit for the time after the crisis has been overcome. If we want to achieve a different policy after the crisis and treat each other differently, then we have to defend ourselves against the current Propaganda according to the pattern of the Berliner Tagesspiegel and the Today's Journal of Claus Kleber and bring it up. This is the only sense of this post.
