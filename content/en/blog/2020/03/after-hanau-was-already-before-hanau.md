What happened in Hanau was certainly not the act of an isolated individual perpetrator, but rather the result of the misanthropic discourse that has been taking place in Germany for years and is now part of everyday life.

When I woke up on Thursday morning and saw the news, I had a queasy feeling. Right Terror in Hanau. Ten dead, nine of them people with migration experience.

Shortly after, I grabbed the phone and called my cousin. She runs a small Café in the city centre of Hanau, and she is a clearly recognisable Muslim. "Everything is fine, but something terrible has happened here," she tells me. Meanwhile, a lot goes through my head. "We", I thought, although I hate to think in these categories, "here" is no longer safe. It was a stroke of luck that my cousin's Café did not become a terrorist target.

A few minutes later I talk to your brother. He is on his way to the hospital. Idrees, his co-worker, Apprentice and friend, is in a coma. Miraculously, the bullet stuck in his jaw and did not penetrate his head any further. Meanwhile, Nessar, Idrees ' brother, was less fortunate and succumbed to his injuries. His Name has since been shared a thousand times, along with those of the other victims. Idrees ' and Nessar's family are from Afghanistan. Her parents had left behind war and destruction in order to give their children a better life in Germany. This was also successful – until 20 February 2020.

While many people within Germany could do little with Hanau, this was different in my case. I know the city well, and because of my many relatives who live there, there were times when we stopped by at least once in the summer. Many migrants from different corners of the world live in Hanau. There are Turks, Kurds, Afghans, Arabs and many people from African countries. Everyone always lived in harmony with each other.

In the end, a single man, whose name I do not want to mention in this Text, could destroy this harmony. After he carried out his massacre, he killed his mother and executed himself.

There are many things that made me angry and hopeless even before Hanau. But even in this case, the medial Déjà vu did not take long, and again there was nothing that could have surprised me. That same night, the BILD newspaper spread fake news by reporting on a "Milieu act". In concrete terms, this means that migrants apparently like to shoot each other and that this must have been the case in this case as well. Other media, such as Focus, reported on "Shisha murders". The fact that this is still brought about after the well-known "Doner Murders" – as the terror of the NSU was once called before it was uncovered – is a class in itself. In addition, of course, there were numerous other things, such as the fact that one reported a "xenophobic" act. The term "xenophobic" basically sums up the whole German Problem. In many other languages, there is no counterpart to it, so outdated, moronic and disconnected from reality the word has become.

But all this made it clear once again that in many German editorial offices there is simply no sensitization – and this will probably not change.

The events in Hanau are not to be regarded as an isolated act of a right-wing terrorist lunatic, but as the result of a long-standing discourse that has become normality in this country. For this reason, I also do not care about the hypocritical attention of the BILD newspaper or the annoying concern in German talk shows. One cannot constantly report about criminal refugees, extremist Muslims and shady mosques or Shisha Bars without continuing the thought.

But the murderer of Nessar and the other young people from Hanau has brought this very thought to an end.

And there are also others who do this, such as the members of the far-right cell who were arrested in Hanau shortly before the crime and who had targeted several mosques throughout Germany. By the way, they received their weapons licenses thanks to a friend at the police station.

And this brings us to the next point.

When Angela Merkel speaks of the poison of racism in front of a crowd of journalists, I can do next to nothing with it. Because it is simply wrong for Merkel and other established parties and politicians to pretend that this racism has simply fallen from the sky and is only to do with the AfD. All the Daily agitation already existed before the rise of the AfD. "Mecca Germany" and co. the title of any right-wing ideologues, or neo-Nazis, but the left-liberal Deputy editors of leading German media.

Apart from the media discourse, there are very clear, racist and neo-Nazi structures within German security bodies, i.e., police, Bundeswehr and Verfassungsschutz. By now, all this is so well known that you don't even have to repeat it at this point. Nevertheless, nothing happened. Absolutely nothing.

#### "Just get away from here"

How bad all this is can only be understood if one is not regarded as part of the German majority society, that is, as a recognizable person with migration experience. Recently-long before Hanau – I had conversations with friends and relatives. A large Portion of them are of the opinion that here, that is, in Europe (Austria, Germany) can no longer live. Racism is too strong, too present. It is becoming more and more uncertain. Some even fear an imminent civil war.

Some of them are considering other countries, such as Canada. Others want to "go back" to Turkey or even Afghanistan. I must admit that I am now also among those who are considering emigration. The main thing is to just get away from here.

The reasons for this can partly be found in my article. Most of what I write about no longer takes place in Germany. The war in Afghanistan, the peace talks with the Taliban, the American "war on Terror". I spend most of my time on that, and although all these issues are pretty dark, I'm happy with it.

Racism, Migration and the German-language media discourse in this regard keep me occupied. That was not always the case, but now I wonder what all this will bring. I used to fall for these topics, but now I've become quite pessimistic. A look at the German media is quite sufficient.

Whether my current attitude will change, will become clear. To Hanau, probably not.

However, I know that many people in this country now feel this way. You are tired. They don't feel like they belong. They want to leave, but they don't really know where to go. But here, too, things are getting tight. Whether in the mosque, in the Shisha Bar or elsewhere.

At the same time, many of these people are more German (or in my case more Austrian) than you can imagine. That concerns me too, and that is probably the Dilemma.
