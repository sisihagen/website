You know [#TTIP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ttip "TTIP on Twitter")? Trade between the United States and Europe is so low, that Germany raised even a [new negative record](http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/__pr/P__Wash/2016/03/02-Trade.html?archive=1992696 "For germany United States the biggest Partner"). This is of course a great defeat in a world where everything's growth is measured. Could be well satisfied with the billion and just enjoy the life. The life of capitalists has only one word, more, more and more. These economists should be deported to 99%. We see our consumption. Two-thirds of all food be disposed, the Smartphones such as films and series to prove the missing research and ideas, in the cities there are only tanning  shops, betting shops and Fast Food restaurants. A single stop seems to be research and development without subsidies. Social development also tends to zero. So this circuit is broken the entrepreneur in Brussels buy an agreement removed all barriers. Borders will fall and that happens while [Europe closes the borders](http://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-closing-borders-1453940487 "Wallstreet Journal explain closed Borders") at the same time for people. This is reasonable as is not introduced, the European stupidity and hypocrisy of human rights and freedom in other cultures.

What mean free trading? The United States and Europe Act for years with success and this trade declined only rarely. Every year new records are reported. Celebrated formally as the Holy Grail. We use American technology, clothing and food. Amazon is also in Europe one of the largest retailers and cities further mutate into ghost towns. Coca Cola, Pepsi, McDonalds we also know in Europe. Nike we also know all. For what we need a contract? A trade contract? The trade has barriers. It costs money and binds workers. This must be changed. The trade is to work as a national package. No additional fees and no additional employees. Cost and labour must be optimized, that the capitalist is called efficient. I find amusing when the German racist again speaks the national slogans and in same time hold [60 slaves](http://www.jetzt.de/politik/interview-mit-einer-professorin-fuer-supply-management "We all has 60 slaves in Asia and Africa") from abroad whose income is so low that slave can afford not even medical care and must see the own children die. Trade and money are freer than the people. People are held earlier by whipping submissive slaves, today to do with money and the lies of freedom, human rights and everyone has a chance. Sounds like a religion? Capitalism is a religion! TTIP does not increase trade, no jobs will be created and missing standards may not fall.

It can be observed that we humans in recent years not learn from history. We see that since the 9/11 particularly by the Western Occident. Violence will be met with violence. Now again with France. With refugees. With Ukraine. With Russia. 20 years and we humans stand still and not move forward. TTIP will not change the moment of still standing. As the name already tells us, solely trade will be free of barriers. The tax will disappear. The jobs that have previously edited the bureaucracy will disappear. The missing tax revenue one day must be reimbursed by the society and society will need to support the unemployed of the bureaucracy. Several damage be so inflicted society while the corporations to the shareholders can make higher payouts. That alone is enough already to reject a free trade agreement. What come more we not know. It is spoken by shadow justice, but we already have that. [Ask Romania!](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/romanian-village-blocks-canadian-firm-mining-for-gold "No Gold so pay us money") [Ask Argentina!](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Argentina-offers-Repsol-US-5-b-compensation-for-YPF-_15532446 "Argentina must pay...") The IMF adjusts something in relevant international treaties. South America, Asia and Africa are blackmailed if necessary to complete up to the Western ideologies. That's a fact we have since second world war is end. It's not about global trade, it involves the exploitation of the many by the few in the Western Occident so that there a wealth, freedom, and democracy can be lied to people in Europe and north America.

Why is so much of the free trade agreement complained actually just in Germany? Is it being debated with arguments that are already existent, without which people focus solely on the word and draw the conclusions? We owe our NGOs. Campact, [Greenpeace](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/ "Greenpeace") and [Attac](https://www.attac.org/en "Attac") are the supposed voice of small. These NGOs are no voice for a motion, they prevent the democratic development and promote the dictatorship. Logos on Events, fundraising that shows the board of directors has no interest in further to work and only the board of directors and not the members say what is to do. Democracy? Have we ever experienced the petitions have been answered? [None](http://www.thewire.com/politics/2010/08/your-online-petition-is-useless/19146/ "Your Online Petition Is Useless")! We see right now in times of third world war what these organizations have done. 1990 times of the first Iraq war were how many people on the streets to demonstrate against it? How many are on the road now? That alone is enough to know that these NGOs not to us talk, but they make us comfortable and move the democratic responsibility.

Let's get to the parasites of which German politicians like swagger. Especially Bavarian and social democratic politicians often use this to distract from own stupidity. Not people who seek help are the problem, it is also not the pensioners and refugees. Rapacious, miserly and ideological bankers, entrepreneurs, and empires which destroy our society and to sponge on expense of others are the problem. We provide to us a question. Can you get rich with work? I don't know any. The tax evaders, the criminals, politicians and liar is rich with Professor and, or Doctor title. The biggest problem is people who make not a handshake and live at the expense of others. That will have an end at some point, then when the social war is finished and then these parasites are dead.
