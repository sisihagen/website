On Thursday, Marija Vladimirovna Sakharova [spoke](http://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/spokesman/briefings/-/asset_publisher/D2wHaWMCU6Od/content/id/3856722?p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_D2wHaWMCU6Od&_101_INSTANCE_D2wHaWMCU6Od_languageId=en_GB#10 "Briefing by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, Moscow, October 17, 2019") about the situation in Venezuela and Cuba. In contrast to the Western media, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls it by name. The economic crisis is a [mass murder](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/US-Sanctions-Killed-Over-40000-Venezuelans-Since-2017-20190425-0015.html "US Sanctions Killed Over 40,000 Venezuelans Since 2017") inflicted on the West, and sanctions do not even apply medication.

#### Venezuela

> We can see de-escalation in the intra-Venezuelan conflict, to a certain degree. Talks continue as part of the national dialogue roundtable, initiated in September between the Bolivarian government and the constructive opposition. They discuss key issues for the further development of the country, such as election system reform and the search for a formula of co-existence of branches of power, as well as possible proposals on how to overcome the economic crisis and streamline migration flows, among other things. We can see here an attempt by Venezuela’s responsible political forces, who care about the future of the country, to finally address the backlog of problems. In addition, it is important that the sides made this dialogue open. Other political parties can join it if they wish.

> With these positive changes, we regret to note our American partners’ unwavering desire to play up the role of the “Russian factor” in Venezuela. It seems the US cannot accept that some Latin American countries continue to protect their positions and stick to their independent domestic and foreign policy even despite the unprecedented sanctions pressure.

> Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov’s visit to Venezuela became a new trigger for anti-Russian statements. Admiral Craig Faller, commander of the United States Southern Command, decided to remind everyone that the Pentagon was not pleased with Russia protecting its interests in the Western Hemisphere. Once again, we can hear speculations about “hundreds of Russian soldiers” and “a significant number of armaments” allegedly deployed in Venezuela, spiced with recollections about flights by Russian strategic bombers that “may carry nuclear weapons.” This looks more like head-on anti-Russian and anti-Latin American propaganda, a course pursued by certain forces in Washington. I would like to repeat this for those who didn’t hear me the first time: Russian military specialists and equipment are deployed in Venezuela in strict compliance with the intergovernmental agreement on military and technical cooperation. We don’t mind explaining our strategic course for the hundredth and two-hundredth time. We will give a clear response, such as a comment, explanation or disavowal of fake news, to all the disinformation.

> At the same time, Washington continues to toughen illegal unilateral sanctions against Venezuela and also Cuba as its closest ally in the region. In his interview with Reuters, US Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said that another package of sanctions was being prepared, now to target Cuba’s tourism sector and also to tighten its grip on the supply of Venezuelan oil to Cuba. He directly threatened to introduce secondary sanctions against Russia because it supported “Maduro’s regime” financially. It seems that Washington feels more and more devastated that the attempts to overthrow the legitimate Venezuelan government failed. US experts responsible for Latin America somehow seem completely confused.

> Let me remind you once again that Russia’s position on Venezuela remains the same: we are in favour of a peaceful political settlement process carried out by the Venezuelans themselves, based on international law and national legislation, without any destructive foreign interference. We will continue to cooperate with other responsible members of the international community to help different political forces in Venezuela reach an understanding. In order to improve the socioeconomic situation in the country, it is necessary to lift sanctions on the humanitarian sphere, above all the supplies of essential goods and medicines, as soon as possible.

> We still hope that our call will be heard in Washington and common sense will prevail at last.

#### Cuba

> Prior to the UN General Assembly vote on a resolution, “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America against Cuba” we would like to draw your attention to one of the most important and sensitive aspects of Washington’s sanctions campaign against undesirable governments – the humanitarian aspect. This time, absolutely wild US sanctions were imposed on the Cuban bio-pharmaceutical industry, threatening the health of thousands of consumers of Cuban produced medications.

> New restrictions that result in targeted, specific damage to average people have been introduced in addition to continuous pressure on Cuban doctors working abroad and annual multi-million losses for the Cuban pharmaceutical industry due to the containment of research.

> Sanctions affect people that have nothing to do with politics and live far from Cuba, who could otherwise receive medications exported by Cuban pharmaceutical companies. Lately, due to the direct and indirect impact of the sanctions, interruptions in raw materials supplies and the manufacturing process stopped the production of 2,000 units of liquid preparations and over 61,000 capsules for the FARMACUBA company; stopped shipments to Cuba of a large consignment of injections of the Phenytoin anti-epileptic medicine from an Asian country; and stopped supplies of almost 2 million packages of Cuban-made parenteral solution to Colombia’s PROENFAR.

> The facts speak for themselves against the backdrop of US politicians’ false concern about human rights. Innocent people again suffer from sanctions that are ostensibly taken in defence of democracy. When the West talks about human rights, it is not always clear who these abstract people are, where they live and what concerns they have. Yet their rights are always “defended”. When it comes to specific people that can be named and counted and their specific rights, all this is instantly forgotten.

> We resolutely reject these and other measures on toughening the US anti-Cuba blockade. There is no doubt that this garrote that is designed to stifle Havana is primarily hitting its average citizens, depriving them of the basic rights and freedoms that are being “defended” by Washington.
