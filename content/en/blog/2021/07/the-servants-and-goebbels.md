The US is pursuing a long-term strategy that serves its imperial interests alone. The former director of the influential think tank Stratfor, George Friedman, explained this vividly in a speech in Chicago in 2015. He said that the main interest of US foreign policy during the last century, in the First and Second World Wars and the Cold War, was relations between Germany and Russia. And the main goal was to prevent cooperation that could challenge the US's supremacy. Because if German capital and German technology were to combine with Russian raw materials and Russian labor, the US would have a major problem, both economically and militarily. That's why they put a security belt around Russia, a "cordon sanitaire," as Friedman called it.

This is what we are dealing with, this is the strategy: no cooperation between Germany and Russia, the United States is securing its position as world power No. 1. In recent years, Russian President Putin has tried to counteract this hubris, which is unjustified and poisoning the global situation, in terms of peace policy. In his impressive speech to the German Bundestag in 2001, he repeatedly offered cooperation. The US countered its unipolar claim with a policy of aggression and military encirclement of Russia.

This has not changed to this day, on the contrary, the confrontation has been pushed to the limit of war. It was and is about eliminating Russia as a power factor and regulative in international politics and subjecting the country to Western capital interests, which, however, did not succeed. Ignoring Western propaganda, Vladimir Putin continues to advocate an understanding between East and West, disarmament and a common economic and cultural space from Vladivostok to Lisbon, most recently in a guest article in the [Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2021-06/ueberfall-auf-die-sowjetunion-1941-europa-russland-geschichte-wladimir-putin/komplettansicht "Offen sein, trotz der Vergangenheit") of 22. He stressed several times that he wanted a better relationship with the US and that there was no obsession in Russia to be a world-ruling superpower.

In Germany, too, a large majority of the population wants [peace and normal relations](/static/downloads/Umfrage_Russland-in-Europa.pdf "Annäherung oder Abschottung?")  with Russia. More and more people are beginning to realize that the policy of confrontation does not come from Russia, as is constantly insinuated, but from the West, especially from the United States and NATO, which it dominates. This insight, which permeates despite the constant incitement and indoctrination, could bring about a change of policy whenever. In any case, we will never give up hope for better, more peaceful times.

There have been two bright spots in recent times: that time has not shied away from publishing the guest article by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the astonishing [conciliatory speech](/static/downloads/210618-D-Russ-Museum-Englisch.pdf "Frank-Walter Steinmeier to mark the 80th anniversary of Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union ") by Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on 18 June on the 80th anniversary of Hitler Germany's attack on the Soviet Union.
