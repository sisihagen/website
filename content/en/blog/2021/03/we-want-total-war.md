"Germany pleases Nato with big defense spending-plus," my regional newspaper rejoices. To continue: "According to a report by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the European alliance states and Canada spent around 3.9 percent more in real terms in 2020 than in the previous year. The Federal Republic of Germany thus increased its expenditure even by 8.4 percent"! With around 785 billion US dollars, the US spent around 2.4 times as much money on "defence" last year as all 29 NATO partners combined. As a reminder: China: 261 billion, Russia: 65.1 billion (2019 each).

These are the daily outrageous lies that are dished up in our media without the authors even noticing it after successful brainwashing by the Pentagon. The United States does not have this insane arms budget for its "defense": Canada and Mexico do not want to invade the United States. The money is spent to keep Russia and China small and encircled, to fight the bomb wars, Dohnen wars and covert wars, and to secure the US domination over the commodity and sales markets of the world.

"Si vis pacem para bellum" â€“ "If You want peace, prepare for war", said the ancient Romans. No sentence has been refuted so often in history.
