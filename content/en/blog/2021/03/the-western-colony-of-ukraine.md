Seven years ago, a US-sponsored and funded coup d'état took place in Ukraine. The Ukrainian oligarchs are in power and smear the pearls to the West. Ukrainians are now heading to Russia, Poland and Western countries for work. A country systematically destroyed by nationalists and puppets.

On February 21, 2014 – on the Maidan in Kiev, just 100 people had died, presumably by bullets from Georgian and Ukrainian [snipers](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Immer-erdrueckendere-Beweise-zu-Maidan-Scharfschuetzen-Einsatz-im-Februar-2014-3970907.html "Immer erdrückendere Beweise zu Maidan-Scharfschützen-Einsatz im Februar 2014") - then German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier signed a compromise paper in Kiev together with his Polish counterpart, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and representatives of the Maidan opposition: it provided for presidential elections until December 2014. But the far-right nationalist wing of Maidan did not recognize the compromise and threatened Yanukovych with violence, after which he fled to the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov on the evening of February 21, 2014.

The flight of Yanukovych made The Ukrainian security structures disoriented. The armed groups of the Ukrainian nationalists effectively took power in Kiev.

On 23 February 2014, the Ukrainian parliament elected the nationalist Olexander Turchynov as the acting president of Ukraine, even though Viktor Yanukovych was still on Ukrainian territory at the time, more precisely in Crimea.

Frank-Walter Steinmeier did not call at the time for compliance with the compromise that had just been reached. So that's what the signature of a German diplomat who dances to the American whistle is worth.

The beneficiaries of the coup d'état in Kiev are Western corporations, which can now buy Ukrainian [black earth fields](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/features-russian-50388919 "сколько ее, кому принадлежит и кто на ней работает")(https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10608951 "Зеленский ввел санкции в отношении телеканалов "112 Украина" и NewsOne") through middlemen, Ukrainian oligarchs whose power now has the blessing of the EU, and nationalist upstarts who, as civil servants and ministers, are doing everything they can to destroy the memory of a social state like the one that existed at the time of the Soviet Union. The last Lenin monument has just been toppled, the last Soviet mosaic of cosmonauts and children scratched from the walls of houses.

Factories were building as markets in Russia collapsed. Wages are not enough to live. The cost of housing is rising and rising. The Ukrainian health system has been completely shattered by US [consultants](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10608951 "Зеленский ввел санкции в отношении телеканалов 112 Украина и NewsOne"). If you still feel strong enough, you go to Poland, Italy or Germany for work. Ukrainians' dissatisfaction is trying to steer the media toward Russia. Since January, only Ukrainian can be spoken in public space.

Ukraine is now a Western colony. The German media are playing along. They are silent about the fact that the opposition in Ukraine has been suppressed and that three opposition Ukrainian television channels have just been shut down.
No wonder most Russians don't want a Maidan, even are afraid of him. Who wants to lose social guarantees, only to be ennobled by the West as a "democratic country"?
