The EU wants a tougher course against Russia, the Atlantic role have of course seen the visit of Borrell in Russia critically. With a rogue state you do not do business, say the representatives whose economy does business with anyone who can only generate a dollar of tax revenue.

Of course Borrell had to point out human rights, to which Navalny should not be imprisoned, new errand boys cost money after all and the right to demonstrate must not be restricted at all. The joke of the matter is. Borrell, or we taxpayers could have saved ourselves the money, after all, we have the völkisch atlantischen racist news of Zeit, Bild, Spiegel, Tagesschau and Co..

As the Russian Foreign Ministry has documented Mr. Borrell has received a DVD on the police violence. Unfortunately, the DVD is not public, would be interesting for many who do not float around on demos to see how the great Western police fulfill their state mission, protection of the oligarchs from the people, so with baton, rubber bullets, fist and water cannons.

There was also an [interview](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4570813 "Интервью Министра иностранных дел Российской Федерации С.В.Лаврова YouTube-каналу "Соловьев Live", 12 февраля 2021 года") with Lavrov which is interesting once again:

> Gentlemen or EU member states. They ultimately determine EU policy. This is a long, contradictory process. Several times individual EU member States have told us in confidence that they are against the sanctions and that they do not believe that Russia should be "punished” with sanctions. They understand that this leads to nothing anyway, but they have "solidarity”, the principle of consensus. I have told you several times that, in my understanding, the principle of consensus means that if someone disagrees, there is no consensus. I never got an answer to that question.

> Back to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrel. He came to us in a difficult situation. Many were against it and have publicly declared that he should not come to Russia unless we "change.” In the end, they agreed on what Josep Borrel had to announce.

> This is not the first time I have noticed – and this concerns not only the EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Borrel, but also his predecessors Mogherini and Ashton - that they do not have the opportunity for negotiations. When Josep Borrel read the position to Navalny, I made counterarguments. The whole position of the European Union was that we have made him a political prisoner and that this has nothing to do with the accusations against him. All this is a violation of human rights and Russia, as a party to many human rights conventions, including the European Convention on Human Rights, is obliged to release him and respect his rights.

> But there are laws in the Russian Federation and they must be respected. By the way, I warned the High Representative that if he presented the issue at the press conference in such a perspective, I would mention as a counterexample the Catalans who were sentenced to 12 or more years in prison for organizing the referendum on Catalan independence. We were accused of organizing the referendum, but no fact, not even anything that looks like a fact, was presented. And so it happened at the press conference.

> As far as human rights are concerned, I reminded Josep Borrell that we have long been willing to engage in substantial dialogue on this issue, but first on the basis of facts and secondly not just in one direction. If human rights are already a recognized issue for which there are no borders and states cannot hide behind their borders when they talk about human rights, then we should agree on what human rights are. These rights are defined. These are primarily socio-economic rights. The right to life is the most important thing. But the West categorically refuses to talk about socio-economic rights.
