In recent weeks, opinion-making against Russia in many major Western media and through parts of politics has once again dangerously exceeded the usual level. In response to media and political hostilities, Russia has now stressed that further sensitive sanctions from the EU side could be tantamount to" severing relations with the EU", Foreign Minister [Lavrov](https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4570813 "Интервью Министра иностранных дел Российской Федерации С.В.Лаврова YouTube-каналу Соловьев Live, 12 февраля 2021 года") said:

> "Let's assume that we are ready (to break off relations in response to tough EU sanctions, Red.) . In a case where we see sanctions being imposed in some areas that expose our economy to risks, even in the most sensitive areas. We don't want to isolate ourselves from global life – but we have to be prepared for it. Whoever wants peace, prepare for war."

#### US lobby in Europe: Against European interests

This is not the first warning from Russia that the important relations between Russia and the EU, which cannot be equated with "Europe", will eventually be seriously damaged by the attacks from the West. Already in the autumn, Lavrov announced that he would respond to Western sanctions with counter-actions. In addition, he had already stressed at the time that Russia was ready to end communication with the European Union for some time.

In addition to existing and planned economic sanctions, as well as the aggressive anti-Russian press campaigns, which are currently based primarily on the Navalny case, there are other hostile signals from "the West" against Russia: in a dangerous step, Ukraine has offered NATO to use its airspace over Crimea for military purposes. And the US Army follows the anti-Russian course of the new US administration and moves US bombers to Norway-against "Russian aggression".

The interplay of factors is extremely worrying: a media campaign of incitement flanked by concrete military threats has been going on for a long time. But now, after years of seeming equanimity, she meets Russian resistance.

#### War: The "Game with fire" is not a game!

The aggressor in this conflict must be the Western side dominated by US interests-these US interests by no means always coincide with EU interests. Russia also knows this, just as Russian experts are aware of how strongly EU policy depends on the US's discretion. For these reasons, too, Russia has long sought dialogue with Germany and the EU despite hostile signals from the EU and Germany. However, Germany and the EU have not shown themselves to be sovereign and independent. Given the harsh rejection of Russian diplomacy-coupled with geopolitical attacks (including in Ukraine and Syria) – Russia's current response cannot come as a surprise. But it should still shake and shock you!

Lavrov's comments should be a wake-up call to slow down those responsible in the media and politics, to end the campaigns and to seek a balance. This "game with fire" is not a game! It is staggering that this simple fact should be emphasized at all, given the German-Russian past.

#### The miracle of German-Russian friendship

It is a miracle that the citizens of Germany, and especially Russia, could once again decide to show mutual sympathy in view of their shared history. However, this miracle has already been partially destroyed, and not only by US strategists and their mainly green allies in Germany: It is hard to bear that a Social Democrat plays a central role in the anti-Russian campaigns with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas: this behavior not only betrays Willy Brandt's legacy, but also destroys further voter potential for the SPD: Many voters expect this party to pursue a rational and balanced policy towards Russia.

To demand its domestic and foreign policy submission as a condition for a compromise with Russia is destructive and hypocritical. On what moral basis, for example, could the Western destroyers of large parts of the Middle East rise above Russia with hundreds of thousands of dead? Moreover, it is not a matter of moral reckoning first, it is also a matter of a healthy geopolitical egoism of the EU and Germany: for us there is no alternative to coexistence with Russia. But for the USA it is. As neighbors, you have to arrange yourself as peacefully as possible, which is also largely independent of the respective governments of Russia and Germany.

With dialogue and the renunciation of geopolitical aggression, the political or social deficits of the other country are not universally recognized: by continuing diplomacy with Germany, Russia certainly does not accept Germany's questionable role in the conflicts in Syria or Ukraine. But it also does not use this behavior of Germany as a pretext to prevent all diplomacy. Similarly, questionable aspects of Russian domestic politics, for example, are not accepted by renouncing hostile interference and geopolitical acts.

#### Who is the aggressor?

The dire current developments between the EU and Russia are fuelled above all by many media and the Greens (but also politicians from other parties). These tendencies carry a concrete military danger and they diminish (mainly because of Heiko Maas) again the election chances of the SPD. And they reveal an inability of the EU to gain its own sovereignty and to pursue its own interests, especially vis-à-vis the US. A touchstone for this sovereignty is currently the completion of the important pipeline Nord Stream 2 against a massive US resistance.

For the fundamental assessment of responsibility for the current escalation and for the question of the aggressor, we refer here to two videos in addition to the Western war crimes of the past years. In this article, a broadcast of the "Weltspiegel" summarizes the fraud and the Western word break in connection with NATO's eastward expansion. And in this infamous video, the director of the US think tank STRATFOR, George Friedman, explains a central goal of US foreign policy in recent decades: to prevent Germany and Russia from coming together.
