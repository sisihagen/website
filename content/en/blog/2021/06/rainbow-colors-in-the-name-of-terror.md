Banks, arms companies and the unscrupulous EU border guards of Frontex use the rainbow colors to present themselves as "progressive". All the hypocrisy can only be endured with a great deal of cynicism.

When Germany's footballers kicked in the Munich Allianz Arena, which was not illuminated in rainbow colours thanks to UEFA's objection, it was a template for politicians of all stripes to sell themselves on social media as upright supporters of "freedom and tolerance". For example, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume proudly showed up with a protective mask in rainbow colors in front of his also unusually colorful masked party leader Markus Söder. The message was clear -" Look, the CSU is great for gays and lesbians and protests really rebelliously against the evil UEFA".

This is amazing, as Markus Blume has just [rejected](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/ehe-fuer-alle-das-entfernt-sich-vom-christlichen.694.de.html?dram:article_id=389831 "Das entfernt sich vom christlichen Eheverständnis") marriage for all, which is a central topic for gays and lesbians, but only a short time before with Bajuwarian Catholic piety-if gays and lesbians are allowed to marry, "it moved away from the Christian understanding of marriage," says Blume. One wonders why he and his party leader would not rather wear a cross on their mouthguards?

But the CSU is in "best" company. In the vote on marriage for all just four years ago, an outsized part of the [CDU deputies](https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/plenum/abstimmung/abstimmung?id=486 "Eheschließung für Personen gleichen Geschlechts") had voted "no". So those who are now " campaigning "for equal rights for gays and lesbians are at the same time denying them the right to marry? Yes, the bigotry under the big " C " is already amazing.

The demonstrative "support" of the rights of people with a homosexual orientation by the German economy is also astonishing. It would be pointless to list here all the German corporations that on Wednesday whitewashed their logo in rainbow colors in the social networks in solidarity. But this "solidarity PR" is of course limited to countries where it is good for the image to pretend to advocate equality for gays and lesbians.

On the social media channels for the Arab market or in "evil" Hungary, such PR was preferred.

Solidarity that costs nothing is cheap. And German corporations are by no means alone in this openly displayed hypocrisy. June is indeed – for whatever reason-the ["Pride Month"](https://www.t-online.de/leben/liebe/id_90156632/-pride-month-darum-feiert-die-welt-im-juni-mit-regenbogenfahnen.html "Darum feiert die Welt im Juni den Pride Month") celebrated in the West. Earlier this month, oppressed homosexuals commemorated their struggle for tolerance and equality. Today, especially the cash registers of advertising agencies and graphic designers are ringing, who fix the logos of Western corporations run through the rainbow filter of Photoshop. But here, too, it is true that these image campaigns refer only to the Western markets and avoid countries where there would actually be something to do for the rights of homosexuals.

Even the employer lobby organization INSM did not miss the opportunity to let its logo shine in the most beautiful rainbow colors, to let a rainbow painted by children's hands rise just in time for the high-profile football match and to appeal to diversity. But the gay temporary worker and the lesbian low-wage worker will be happy. What the neoliberal impoverishment policy that the INSM calls for should now have to do with diversity and the rights of homosexuals, however, probably remains the secret of the advertising strategists.

And what the big corporations and lobby organizations can do, state organizations can of course for a long time. The German police can also join the system-compliant "protest" and painted some of their official vehicles with a rainbow especially for the photographers. Wow! There you just wait for the Village people to get out and give their" YMCA " to the best.

The EU border protection force of Frontex shows itself this month really nice "cosmopolitan" and " rebellious "and stands fully behind the rights of the" LGBT community "and refers to the" basic values of the EU " of equality and non-discrimination.

That's great! Does this mean that, for once, no gay refugees persecuted for their sexual orientation will be deported during Pride Month? Or, for once, may lesbian refugees travel to the sacred fortress of Europe in their overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean? Or do you leave it at the symbolism and decorate the tanks with which you chase the refugees back into the sea in Ceuta, perhaps with rainbow flags?

You think that's cynical? Then wait a minute. What German and European corporations and organizations are screwing up under the banner of the rainbow is still nothing against the motherland of bigotry. In the USA, there is probably no group that still dares not pay tribute to the "Pride Month" and to position itself publicly under the banner of the rainbow. Of course, this also includes the world's largest arms companies. Whether it's Raytheon ...

The corporations, whose products kill people worldwide and who, through their lobby associations and think tanks, advocate a militarization of foreign policy, always like to take the opportunity to present themselves as human friends through the LGBTQ movement. One can only reply to the well-known Max Liebermann quote: "I can't eat as much as I want to puke."

The rainbow today is just a farce. A movement like the environmental movement, which are becoming NGO's and don't have to work themselves. Perhaps the numerous users, who now also provide their social media profile pictures with a rainbow, think about whether they want to get in touch with the INSM, Frontex or even the defense industry. As a symbol of resistance and the demand for equality and tolerance, the rainbow has unfortunately become obsolete.

Of course, equality, tolerance and all conceivable rights for gays and lesbians are important demands – both in this country and in countries where other sexual orientations are persecuted and suppressed by force. However, the inflationary and empty use of the originally critical symbol has led to arbitrariness, so that today the rainbow has become system-compliant and irrelevant. The rainbow has faded.
