It's all terribly depressingly predictable: Hamas will fire more rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip; Israel will retaliate massively against any attack; in Jerusalem, Palestinians and Israeli security forces will fight each other at least sporadically; the Palestinian leadership will entrench itself behind walls in order not to hold elections – and the Israeli government, with or without Netanyahu, will continue to tactic between the demands of the forces around the powerful settler movement and those politically weak circles that demand a more moderate strategy towards the Palestinians. Western governments will demand (also still, it bores probably already almost all readers world-wide) so-called restraint of all involved. And the leading Arab regimes (Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the first place) will express their indignation at Israel every new outbreak of violence, then remain silent for some time, then return to the courant normal, which concretely includes: "We are in solidarity with the Palestinians, with Muslims in general, but in reality we recognize the realities, that is, the strength of Israel and the possibilities to remain allies of the United States thanks to relations with Israel."

Human Rights Watch recently branded Israel with the term "apartheid". It is possible to argue about comparisons in contemporary history – but how, with what other expression, for example, this case should be referred to (it is a mosaic or domino in the current conflictual situation in Jerusalem).

#### Israeli courts support " right of withdrawal"

Jewish settler organizations have enforced in Israeli courts that several Palestinian families will soon be expelled from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem. The reason: the land on which the houses in question are located was bought by a Jewish foundation in 1876. But in 1948, Jordan conquered the eastern part of Jerusalem and had homes built there for Palestinian refugees who had been expelled from the territory of the new state of Israel. In 1967, however, Israel conquered, in the Six-day War, among others. the east part of Jerusalem. And since then, certain Israeli organizations (in the specific case financed by sympathizers in the USA) have been trying to enforce a right to "take back" corresponding houses / apartments / land in Israeli courts. Often with success.

This is one side of the coin – the other should fairly be that Palestinians who once owned a house, a flat, a plot of land in the territory of Israel would also have a right to take possession of the corresponding object. But: no, there is no such right. Why? Because no answer is given to this question, Human Rights Watch, as mentioned, brand Israel as an apartheid state.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is based, on the micro level, on such and similar problems-in this country we would say: "from legal fodder". This also applies to many disputes over rights in the Israeli – occupied West Bank-they are based on culturally and historically different ideas and practices. Concretely: in the widespread Arab tradition, including that of the Palestinians, the rights for the land, the terrain, have for centuries been granted for the majority not for a possession in the Western sense, but only for the use, for example, for grazing rights or for the yield from cultivated crops. The land, at least in theory, remained in the possession of the general public – but what was built on the land, houses, etc., was recognized as private property.

Why is this important now? Because this different understanding of rights on land, on land, leads Israel to often argue in the territory of the Palestinians that there are no legally verifiable "titles". Thus, the Israeli state could declare itself "entitled" to the corresponding terrain without violating any claims. In many cases, for example, the Israeli claim to lands on which Israeli settlements (most of which developed into veritable small towns) were built in the West Bank was justified.

In the current spiral of escalation, various forces are fatally intertwined: indignation of many Palestinians over the displacement from neighborhoods in East Jerusalem; harshness of the Israeli troops ' action against gatherings of Palestinians around the al-Aqsa mosque; frustration, mainly among young Palestinians, with their own elderly Fatah leadership; search for profile on the part of the semi-loser Netanyahu; rivalry between the Palestinian forces Fatah and Hamas. And, among the people of the Gaza Strip, this hopelessly overpopulated mini-area (360 km2, nearly two million people), there is clearly a sense of daily increasing hopelessness.

#### International Disinterest

Plus: perplexity and ultimately disinterest internationally. Probably also applies to Switzerland – who really wants to read, hear, see articles about the Palestinians in detail in our media? Just look through the newspapers on Tuesday, May 11, the day 24 people in the Gaza Strip were killed by Israeli rockets and over a hundred were injured in Jerusalem? Where, again, rockets from Gaza hit Israeli cities? In the news broadcasts of Radio SRF there were still small hints, at least in the morning, however, so-called reports about the work of cleaning staff in a few cities of Switzerland seemed much more interesting. And at lunchtime, the problems in the Middle East were already overlaid by videos / reports of a rampage in Kazan, Russia.

So it will probably continue.
