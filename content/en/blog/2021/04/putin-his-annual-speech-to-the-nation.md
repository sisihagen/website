Putin's speech to the nation is a major topic in the Russian media every year. The Western media ignore this event, if more people heard this speech, Western politicians would be exposed as stupid party dictators and oligarchs ' errand boys.

{{< video "/static/downloads/putin_speech_nation_april_2021.mp4" "Putin Speech to the nation" >}}

The speech lasted almost an hour and a half and the focus this year was on domestic issues. The foreign country was only evaluated in about 10 minutes.

I would like to record here a few fetuses from the speech.

#### 1. Real Estate

In contrast to Germany, there are no housing associations in Russia and capital indicators that rent apartments. Renting is exclusively private and that also rather rare. In Russia, ownership is much higher than it is in Germany.

In Russia, a lively construction boom has been observed for years, entire districts have been newly built and renovated. Putin briefly addressed the future of housing.

> "The expansion of infrastructure on a large scale presents the construction industry with fundamentally new challenges. In the rather difficult past year, it worked smoothly and ensured the completion of more than 80 million square meters of living space. This is a good result. The more we build, the more affordable housing becomes for Russian families. That is why we have the ambitious goal, we have already talked about, of building about 120 million square meters of new housing every year, and this ambitious goal remains. Therefore, we must provide for a special mechanism to promote housing."

#### 2. Promoting the economy after Corona

Russia has launched a great deal of economic support since Corona. On the contrary to Germany, only small and medium-sized enterprises are supported and the support is of course tied to conditions such as protection against dismissal.

> "Last year, we provided unprecedented funding to support the economy, including through preferential loans to pay salaries, and secured more than five million jobs. I would like to point out that this program has worked, but it has worked precisely because the economy has shown responsibility and tried to do everything possible to keep the workforce. That was obvious. Unfortunately, layoffs could not be completely avoided. I understand how difficult it is for those who have lost their jobs. The government had set itself the task of restoring the labour market by the end of this year. But we should try to solve the problem earlier so that people can get a stable income more quickly. To support the creation of new jobs, the government will promote entrepreneurial initiatives and stimulate private investment."

In Russia, of course, there are also social contributions, which amount to 30 percent and are to be paid by the employer. In Russia, the net wage is always negotiated when hiring, gross only knows the employer. The employer also deducts the payroll tax (13 percent). In order to help the economy quickly, social security contributions have now been reduced by half in the long term to support small and medium-sized enterprises permanently:

> "Last year, as you know, we halved social security contributions for small and medium-sized enterprises from 30 to 15 percent. This decision is permanent, a change is not examined."

Next Putin said:

> "I instruct the government to submit additional proposals within one month to support small and medium-sized enterprises, including tax incentives, affordable credit and expanded distribution of their products, including through purchases by large state-owned enterprises."

In order to help small and medium-sized enterprises, state-owned enterprises are instructed to buy there instead of from corporations. The Western state cannot provide such help, everything is privatized there.

#### 3. Environmental issues

Russia has inherited enough environmental problems from the Soviet Union and the Russian government has long recognized that the nature of Russia and its sustainable use is one of the country's greatest riches. Both economically and for people's quality of life. Accordingly, the government reacted harshly to the incident in Norilsk and tightened laws. In his speech, Putin once again intervened and said::

> "The efforts of all levels of government, economy, development institutes and the Russian Academy of Sciences must be subordinated to the central main task: improving the quality of life of our people. And here I would like to emphasize that our approaches to environmental protection are of an absolutely principled nature and will not be changed in any case. Recent events in Norilsk, Usolye-Sibirsk and several other places have shown that it can also go in the other direction. We will definitely help the people who live there, but we must not allow such environmental events to be repeated. I ask the Parliament to speed up the adoption of the law according to which companies are financially liable for the repair of the damage and for the reclamation of the industrial sites. The approach is very simple. It sounds like this: if you make a profit at the expense of nature, you have to clean up the dirt. We have to take a hard line here. The Russian Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory authorities must fulfil their obligations."

Another problem in Russia are wild landfills in the province. Putin has once again pointed out that it remains with the hard gait:

> "I add that the polluter pays principle must also be fully implemented in the field of waste management in order to ensure the transition to the so-called circular economy. To this end, we need to introduce this year a mechanism for extended responsibility of manufacturers and importers for the disposal of goods and packaging."

Putin is a friend of funds that are used for specific purposes. Penalties, etc., because of environmental crimes should be collected according to and for the environment used to be marked :

> "I also propose to "mark" the receipts for ecology in the federal budget. I know that experts and financiers do not like such "markings", but nevertheless this is an extremely important area of our work. Here we can make an exception. We can use this money specifically to repair the accumulated damage and improve the environment."

Here, too, Russia wants to take action and greatly reduce the emission of pollutants, and in Russia, the goals set by the government are also being implemented, as the past has shown. In his speech, Putin said on the subject:

> "And as I said before, the emission of harmful emissions into the atmosphere in the country's 12 largest industrial centers must be reduced by 20 percent by 2024. We have already talked about it. This objective must necessarily be achieved through an integrated modernisation of the industrial, housing, transport and energy sectors."

#### 4. Child and family support

There are many people studying in Russia. After Yeltsin downplayed the Russia had become free university places rare, about the current state of the change Putin also expressed:

> "In a month, the 11th graders will graduate from high school. After that, the majority, about 60 percent, will be able to obtain state-funded university places. I can rightly say that there is no other country in the world that offers such comprehensive free access to higher education as Russia. In the next two years, we will establish a further 45,000 university places financed by the state budget. No less than 70 percent of them are allocated to the regions of the Russian Federation where graduates are needed."

To finance the course with such a project must stand there is a plan:

> "Starting this year, at least 100 universities in the regions will receive grants of 100 million rubles (about 1.1 million euros) and more each to open technology parks for students and incubators, modernize their teaching and laboratory facilities and study programs. All state universities can claim this support, including those that train future teachers, doctors, transport and cultural workers. I am sure that the young generation of Russians, the Russian scientists, will be heard in new important research projects."

Single mothers also exist in Russia and, like everywhere else in Russia, they do not have it easy.

> "But a number of new decisions must be taken now, today, without delay. It is always difficult to raise a child as a single parent. There can be many reasons for someone raising their child alone. It's not about the reasons, it's about supporting the children. It is particularly difficult when such a family is in a difficult financial situation, especially when the children go to school and the costs of the family budget become greater. These families, in which a mother or father raise a child alone, must be supported separately. As a result, from 1 July this year, children aged 8 to 16 who grow up in such families will receive support. The average amount in the country will be 5,650 rubles (just over 60 euros) per month."

The support of pregnant women has also made it into the speech:

> "And of course we have to help women who are expecting a child and are also in financial difficulties. For the mother-to-be, it is very important to feel supported by the state and society so that they carry their child and be sure that they are helped to raise the child and put it on its own feet. I propose to provide for a monthly payment for women who are in an early stage of pregnancy and are in a difficult financial situation. On average, this payment will amount to 6,350 rubles (just over 70 euros) per month nationwide."

In Russia, parents of sick children are written ill:

> "Now, of course, the amount of continued payment of wages in the event of illness for the care of a child generally depends on the professional years, and that is, of course, right and just. But this means that these payments are significantly lower for young women. This topic was discussed in the State Council and also addressed by the party "United Russia". In the near future, legislative decisions will have to be taken to ensure that the continued payment of wages in the event of illness for the care of a child from this year is 100 percent of the wage for children under 7 years of age. It is clear what it is all about – most people in the room understand it: the more years of work, the higher the continued payment of wages. Women with many years of work get 100 percent, but most of them do not get any more children. But those who have children do not get 100 percent. But we should support those who have children."

In order to effectively increase the birth rate, appropriate subsidies are also being discussed here.

> "I would also like to remind you that the maternity capital programme has been extended and extended until 2026. Now the right to it exists already from the first child. In the past, we couldn't afford it. Maternity capital was indexed at almost 640,000 rubles (just over 7,000 euros)."

In schools, children now get free food, books, etc.

> "I stress that during the epidemic all our decisions were aimed at supporting the citizens. But I understand that even now it is not easy for many, many people. The labour market and the real disposable income of citizens will definitely be restored and we will continue to move forward. But that has not yet happened. And that's why I propose another lump sum payment to families with school – age children-10,000 rubles (just over 110 euros) for each school-age child. And this measure must also be extended to the future first-graders, to the children who will be enrolled this year. The payment is made in mid-August, so that parents have time to prepare their children for school."

#### 5. Social justice and the responsibility of the economy

Putin takes the economy and the good earners into his own hands. The top rate of tax has been increased, but the multiples are earmarked. Those earning more than 55,000 euros pay 15 percent payroll tax instead of 13. This is used to finance medicine for poorer people, for example.

> "I thank all the groups in Parliament who have supported the decision on the taxation of high incomes, more precisely, on some of these high incomes. The proceeds go to the special fund "Kreis des Guten" (Circle of Good) and already helps children suffering from rare and serious diseases to pay for expensive medicines, medical equipment and surgeries."

Putin has threatened the corporations who pay dividends instead of investing and securing jobs must expect consequences.

> "I will now say something important, but not new, the economy already knows that. The profits of the economy promise to reach a new record this year despite all the problems. Despite all the problems, it looks like it. We will see how these profits are used and we will take this into account when we decide on possible further adjustments to tax laws at the end of the year. I am waiting here for concrete proposals from the government. Let me say, as they say, outside the protocol: some draw dividends, while others invest in the development of their companies and entire industries. Of course, we will encourage those who invest."

#### 6. Tourism

The Russian likes to go on holiday and like in Germany you have discovered your own country in the last year. This was noticed by Putin.

> "In order to give as many people as possible the opportunity to relax in sanatoriums and resorts, I propose to extend the program, under which the citizen gets 20 percent of his expenses for tourist trips within Russia, at least until the end of the year."

So that everyone can take a holiday, 20 percent of the travel costs will be reimbursed.

> "In order to give as many people as possible the opportunity to relax in sanatoriums and resorts, I propose to extend the program, under which the citizen gets 20 percent of his expenses for tourist trips within Russia, at least until the end of the year."

In Russia, holiday camps are still very much in demand, I also spent a lot of time there and it was always something nice. However, the costs are high and the state wants to pay for this soon.

> "We must pay special attention to the health of our children. After all, the foundation for health is laid in childhood for many years in advance. Holidays for children must be made as accessible as possible. Therefore, I propose to reimburse half of the travel expenses for holiday camps this year."

For students there was also an idea:

> "In addition, we need to create additional opportunities for student tourism and already this year launch pilot projects to make accommodation in universities and dormitories of other regions accessible to students who will travel around the country in the summer."

#### 7. Foreign policy

> At the end also want to say a few words about the meaning and content of Russian politics on the international stage. The purpose and content of our policy is to ensure peace and security for the well-being of our citizens and for the stable development of our country. Russia, of course, has interests that we defend within the framework of international law and for which we will stand, just as other states of the world do. And if someone does not understand this obvious thing, does not want to have a dialogue, but chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to stand up for its position.

> At the same time, unfortunately, everyone in this world seems to have become accustomed to the practice of politically motivated, illegal economic sanctions, to the crude attempts of some to force their will on others. But today this practice is reborn into something much more dangerous – I mean the recent attempt to organize a coup d'état in Belarus and the assassination of the president of that country. It is significant that the so-called collective West itself does not condemn such monstrous actions. No one there took notice of it. Everyone pretends that nothing has happened at all.

> But listen, you can stand for example to the President of Ukraine Yanukovych or to Maduro in Venezuela, as you like. I repeat, one can stand by Yanukovych, who was removed from power with the help of an armed coup and who was also almost murdered, however one wishes. It is possible to have any opinion on the policy of the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. But the practice of organizing coups, plans for political assassinations, including high – ranking representatives of states-well, that's too much, it has already crossed all borders.

> And what alone the confessions of the imprisoned participants of the conspiracy testify that they planned the blockade of Minsk, including the urban infrastructure and means of communication, the complete shutdown of the entire power grid of the capital of Belarus! By the way, this means that preparations for a massive cyber attack have actually been made. How else? You know, you can't do that by simply flipping a switch.

> Western colleagues do not seem to reject the numerous Russian proposals to establish an international dialogue in the field of information technology and cyber security without reason. We have proposed this many times. But they all refuse to even talk about the subject.

> And what would have happened if the coup attempt had really been carried out in Belarus? That almost happened. How many people would have been injured? How would the fate of Belarus have developed as a whole? Nobody thinks about that.

> Just as no one thought about the fate of Ukraine when the coup was carried out in the country.

> At the same time, the unfriendly actions against Russia do not stop. In some countries it has become an unpleasant custom to attack Russia at every opportunity, and mostly for no reason. This has become a sport, a new sport that makes the loudest statements.

> We behave very cautiously in this respect, I say it directly and without irony, we behave modestly. Often we do not only not react to unfriendly actions, but also not to open insolence. We want to have good relations with all participants of the international community. But we see what is really happening: as I said, Russia is attacked here and there for no reason. And of course around them, as with Shir Kahn, all the little tabaqui, just as with Kipling, are ready to serve their sovereign. Kipling was a great writer.

> We really want to have good relations with all the participants in the international community, including those with whom the relations at the moment – to say the least – are not so good. We really don't want to break any bridges. But if someone perceives our good intentions as indifference or weakness and intends to completely break off or even blow up these bridges, they should know that Russia's response will be asymmetrical, fast and hard.

> The organizers of any provocations that threaten the fundamental interests of our security will regret what has been done, as they have not regretted anything for a very long time.

> At the same time, I must say clearly, we have enough patience, responsibility, professionalism, self-confidence, self-assurance in the correctness of our position and common sense when it comes to making any decisions. But I hope that no one will think about crossing Russia's so-called red lines. And where they go, we determine ourselves in each specific case.

> As is customary in the annual speeches to the nation, I must again mention today that the improvement and qualitative strengthening of the Russian armed Forces is constantly going on. We pay particular attention to the development of military training, both in military training facilities and on the basis of military training centres at civilian universities.

> By 2024, the proportion of modern weapons and equipment among troops will be almost 76 percent, which is a very good indicator. And in the nuclear triad, it will already exceed 88 percent this year.

> The latest Intercontinental hypersonic missile of the type "Avangard" and the Laser-fighting complex "Peresvet" are already in service and the first Regiment, equipped with the heavy Intercontinental ballistic missiles "Sarmat" will be the end of 2022, according to a Plan ready to use.

> The number of hypersonic missiles of the type "Kinzhal" is increased. The number of ships equipped with these mentioned precision hypersonic weapons and with the cruise missiles "Kalibr" continues to increase. In the near future hypersonic rockets of the type "Zircon" will be put into service. Work on other state-of-the-art systems, including "Poseidon", "Burevestnik" and other systems, is proceeding according to plan.

> As a leading country in the development of next-generation combat systems, in the development of modern nuclear forces, Russia once again calls on partners to discuss issues related to strategic armaments in order to ensure global stability. The aim of such negotiations could be to create an environment of conflict-free coexistence based on equal security, covering not only traditional strategic weapons such as intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers and submarines, but also, I would stress, all offensive and defensive systems capable of solving strategic tasks, regardless of their equipment.

> The five nuclear states bear a special responsibility here. I hope that the Russian initiative for the personal meeting of heads of state and government – the permanent members of the UN Security Council, which we proposed last year-will be implemented and that it will take place as soon as epidemiological conditions permit.

> Russia is always open to broad intergovernmental cooperation. We have consistently worked to maintain and strengthen the key role of the United Nations in world politics, we are determined to contribute to the resolution of regional conflicts, and we have already done much to stabilize the situation in Syria and start political dialogue in Libya. Russia, as you know, has played an important role in ending the armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

> On the basis of mutual respect, we build relationships with the vast majority of the world's nations: in Asia, Latin America, Africa and with many European countries. Consistently and as a matter of priority, we are expanding contacts with our closest partners in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BRICS, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the allies of the Collective Security Treaty Organization.

> Our joint projects under the Eurasian Economic Union aim to ensure the growth of the economy and the well-being of citizens. At the same time, there are new interesting directions, such as the development of transport and logistics corridors. I am sure that they will become a reliable infrastructure framework for the great Eurasian partnership. The Russian ideas of this broad open association are already being put into practice, including through consolidation with other integration processes.

> All these are not speculative geopolitical constructions, but practical instruments for solving the problems of national development.
