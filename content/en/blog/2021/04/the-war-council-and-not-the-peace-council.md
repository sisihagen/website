Up to the social-alternative scene, even up to the left movement, the discussion about NATO is characterized by an ignorance that leads to dangerous misjudgments.

This is how the defence spokesman of the LEFT in the Bundestag, Matthias Höhn, speaks of NATO as a "defence alliance”. A similar trivialization has long been widespread among the Greens – here is an exemplary quote from a motion of the Greens in the Bundestag on 70 years of Nato:

> "From the point of view of European security, NATO has so far remained the central actor alongside the EU that can guarantee the common security of Europe.”

The blindness to Nato, its high and nuclear weapons and its escalation strategy towards Russia, which undermines the security and the future of Europe and of humanity as a whole, which emerges here as with transatlantic social Democrats, arises from an ignorance of the scenarios developed by Nato for what it calls the "war in the 21st century” and for which the military implements military programmes and manipulates the public.

In order to recognize the danger and cynicism of the so-called security policy, a look at the military and strategic events at the NATO site Kalkar on the northwestern edge of the Ruhr area is sufficient. According to the then (2016) Kalkar director General Wundrak (now AfD), the NATO location in the idyll on the left bank of the Rhine is one of the "very big players in the German Armed Forces, but also in Nato". They are constantly building and expanding this control centre for the air war in the 21st century for three-digit millions. For years, the documents of the NATO strategic forge stationed there, called the ‘Joint Air Power Competence Centre’ (JAPCC), have illustrated the existential danger of war planning, some of which is very concrete even in technical terms, which continues the Cold War and which plans it very concretely hotly, as shown by a recommendation of the text with the meaningful title, which was first published in the 1970s.

The 2010 Journal 11 of the JAPCC stated that” there was concern about the risk of a strategic imbalance between Russia and NATO". The East-West confrontation obviously pervades the thinking and concepts of NATO strategists as an irrefutable fixum like in the Cold War.

The German government and NATO founded the JAPCC strategy forge in 2005 as a so-called’Centre of Excellence'. The main source of funding is the federal budget.

The JAPCC Annual Conferences document the outstanding importance of the JAPCC for NATO strategy development.

The 2006 annual conference dealt with Nato's' Unmanned Aerospace Capabilities 'during the war, the 2007 annual conference dealt with 'Expeditionary Operations'. This was about acts of war without a declaration of war, i.e. a violation of international law. The drone strategy was co-conceptualized here. Decision-making is one of the motives of the military. In keeping with the approach of concretely preparing for war, the 2008 conference was about ‘battlefield management’ and this contradicts the peace commandment of the Basic Law.

The title of the 2012 annual Conference is not to be brought into line with the peace principle of international law and the Basic Law. At their 2014 conference "Future Vector", those responsible declared a major war in Europe possible: in the conference manuscript it was stated: "The assumption that there would be no more major war in Europe is to be doubted". Instead of preventing such a catastrophe, the military calls for an "appropriate mix of conventional and nuclear capacities"on page 70 of the Kalkar Future Vector manuscript.

The correct answer to this martial planning Bert Brecht's words in the great Carthage, which was after the first war, yet powerful, after the second still habitable, and after the third no longer be found. The strategists also indicated quite precisely where they see the starting point of the great war: on Russia's western border between Georgia and the Baltic States. They explain NATO's eastward expansion as a factor for the pacification and stabilization of Europe (ibid., p. 39). They manipulate the public through embellishment, through des-information: they forget the fact that the western side of the then Soviet Union promised during the negotiations on the unification of the two German states, the GDR and the FRG, that NATO does not extend to the east.

The conferences have been held at Messe Essen since 2015. The conference centre at Messe Essen is highly attractive for the military-industrial complex, as it is possible to generously present the latest technical achievements of destructive power development to the decisive target audience. And conversely, the military leadership can make initial arrangements with political decision-makers about new strategies and technological possibilities in the run-up to subsequent political decisions. About 300 high-ranking military personnel, arms industrialists, politicians and strategists come together to advise on warfare and strategies for its implementation and implementation.

For example, Christian Motzer, then personal speaker of the CDU/CSU group chairman Volker Kauder, spoke at the NATO Conference in Essen in 2016. The first Essen conference dealt with "Strategic Communication". In this conference, the military dealt with the 'problem' that they saw in the fact that the population of Germany, in their opinion, had too little support for NATO's actions. Their answer was that we need simple and emotional stories with clear good-bad messages, which politicians also agree in such a way that NATO can pursue its strategies without resistance and with the widest possible support. The letter of invitation, which is no longer online, stated that there are entities that are hostile to Nato (hostiles) and that, with some success, encourage a critical attitude among the population towards military operations. This is involuntary praise to the peace movement. After this conference, NATO established a Centre of "Excellence” in Riga, in the Baltic States, entitled "Strategic Communication".

Instead of manipulating thought and action in the sense of militarization, humanity needs human communication, even in public discourse.

In 2017, the conference entitled ‘Deterrence’ called for NATO to have plans to use nuclear systems, as they would not be deterred if they were not ready to be used. (Preparatory manuscript ‘Nato Deterrence', p. 40) The conclusion was to develop doctrines and plans for the use of nuclear potentials. The evaluation manuscript of this conference became concrete: the Baltic States could only be defended conventionally with too much effort. The solution was to lower the nuclear threshold, that is, to open the nuclear war as an element of deterrence.

The 2018 conference dealt with the’ fog of Day zero', with day zero marking not the end of the war but its beginning. It is indeed about war preparation.

The 2019 conference concretized the preparation for a combat event with the concept of the interlocking application of all types of weapons from space to the Air Force to the Internet through cyber-war pollution programs and Trojans, which can even attack nuclear power plants or the entire financial, health policy, finance, resources and mobility-controlling infrastructure. This multi-domain operations concept was to be further refined in 2020, with the NATO meeting looking at jump innovations such as drones and other innovations for the war trade. Corona led to the cancellation of the conference.

The peace movement demands that strategic planning, which calls into question the peaceful coexistence of the peoples, be prohibited, but the city of Essen and the state government show no willingness to enforce the basic law at this point.

For ten years, the peace movement has been drawing the public's attention to the incendiary events at the Kalkar site and at the NATO conferences in Essen with various protest actions such as laying wreaths, demonstrations, conferences and press conferences. During the peace actions, Konstantin Wecker, Margot Käßmann and Gabriele Krone-Schmalz, among others, called for a policy of peace in Europe and encouraged the forces of peace to expand their commitment.

Margot Käßmann explained in this context :" There should be an outcry around the world: 'Put down your weapons!’ ". Gabriele Krone-Schmalz explained how Eugen Drewermann had expressed it at the Essen Peace Demonstration 2015:

> "The great task of this century seems to me to be to dismantle images of the enemy and face realities, instead of starting crusades with a Western ideology of value, which have not brought anything anywhere in the world in the sense of human rights and humanity. And in this respect, it is high time to put a stop to the increasingly hysterical demonization of Russia."

In 2021, the conference will focus on the provision of striking power at the pace required by the relevance so assessed by the military. The military has clearly stated that victories depend on a strategy based on speed.

This Council of war is directed against the future. The peace and ecology movements are called upon in their peace ecological resistance to enlighten, to protest and to thwart these plans. With a peace demonstration in Essen on the first weekend of September, before the planned JAPCC conference, peace forces are becoming active in this sense. According to its significance, this action will be a culmination of the democratic commitment of the ecology and peace movement shortly before the end of the election campaign.
