The claim that high and nuclear weapons, military interventions and deterrence bring "security" is being promoted for militarization. The forces of peace therefore have to do with a strong opponent who is pushing in the direction of a great war. A speech on the past Easter marches.

Dear Friends of Peace,

we have fought for the fact that we stand here today and demonstrate for peace and disarmament, against a federal government that increasingly regards basic democratic rights as a privilege and not as a historically acquired right of the people.

A storm of protest has thwarted these plans! We have defended democracy and will do so again and again, because we need democracy like the air to breathe in our struggle for peace. Fundamental rights are not a larifari for good times. Freedom is not a privilege, it is a right and I add: a hard-won right when we look into history.

When there is so much talk about lockdowns, let's start with one: lockdown for the military and armor and that means stop the unspeakable maneuver Defender 2021. Lockdown for the armament, for the incitement against Russia and China. This would be good for the health of the world, for the climate and for all people.

I add: health is more than the absence of viruses! As dangerous as these are.

#### Peace

Yes, this peace is in great danger!

  - When the US president refers to the Russian president as a murderer and, by the way, has agreed to all US war operations in violation of international law over the past 49 years.

  - If the Prime Minister of Great Britain wants to increase the number of British nuclear weapons from 180 to 240.

  - When the Minister of Defense of our country states at the Maritime Leadership Meeting in March: "On average, the Bundeswehr gets a new tank every week, a new aircraft every month and a new ship every year."

  - When defensive missiles and new nuclear weapons are deployed around China and declared, this serves to eliminate China's secondary strike capabilities.

  - Defender maneuvers to the east, the Middle East and the Far East

  - NATO planning 2030 and the strategies of aggression

  - Last but not least armed drones: assault weapons

It stinks of war, of great war! There are wars looming that we cannot and do not want to imagine!

This is the real danger in which these Easter marches take place.

And so remains true and true, as it says in the most famous Easter march song:

> "Are we marching against the East? No! Are we marching against the West? No! We march for the world that no longer believes in weapons, because that is best for us."

We know:

Once again, the forces of peace are once again opposed to the opinion - mongering that promotes militarization by claiming that high and nuclear weapons, military interventions and deterrence bring ‘security’ and that Nato, with its wars, its armor and its threat scenes, is a peace power.

The forces of peace and the future have to do with a strong opponent who is pushing in the direction of a great war:

  -In May 2020, for example, the German Federal Government's Science and Policy Foundation recommended that NATO states be able to wage a ‘limited nuclear war’ (SWP Study 11, p.8).

  - And former security officials of the US National Defense Strategy Commission warned in late 2018 that the US could lose the next war (CBS,11/14/18). They declared: "America's ability ... to defend its vital interests is increasingly being questioned ... It may have difficulty winning a war against China or Russia ...The return of great power competition by authoritarian powers such as Russia and China is returning."

  - The plan to spend more than € 80 billion annually in the federal budget for the military is also linked to the preparation of such a war with nuclear powers. (2022 46.9, 2021 NATO criteria 53 billion)

  - The digitization of war technology, the development of novel nuclear systems as well as the expansion of armies and their infrastructure follows the concept of networked warfare.

The doomsdale clock is set to 100 seconds before midnight.

The core and crystallization point is NATO. This war preparation has a name: NATO. And already the name has long been a lie – much more: the worldwide military alliance.

#### NATO

Nato, which spends more than half of the world's arms expenditure at 1100 billion US dollars, makes billions of dollars in profits for the arms industry and contributes to the dangers for humanity with its CO2 emissions, resource consumption and destruction of nature as strongly as any other institution on Earth. It is incompatible with the life interests of the people in our country and worldwide. Life can only be saved with a consistent policy of social justice, cooperation instead of capitalist competition for profit and supremacy. Peace is the basis of sustainable politics.

The world is too small, too vulnerable, nature too endangered for wars and military. Climate justice requires no to war and Yes to disarmament.

The US is using NATO for its imperial policy of global intervention to secure its supremacy and access to resources in the global competition for strategic advantages and for its frontline position against China and Russia. Germany's policy supports this policy with transatlantic vassalage and even with the attempt to contain China with the Navy (Kramp-Karrenbauer: "...we oppose...").

Peace policy, on the other hand, is directed towards social-ecological justice, both internally and externally. Nato and the EU hide imperial interests not only in resources and influence, but also in trade routes and glorify their power politics as a defense of democratic values.

NATO - the worldwide aggressive war alliance.

We know that NATO is undermining the UN and other state alliances for the peaceful resolution of conflicts.

  -Nato is facing devastating military spending by member states: 1.1 billion dollars in 2020. The social and environmental impact of military actions and armaments is destroying the livelihoods of billions of people.

  - Nato manipulates thinking through propaganda with double standards and trivializing the military with terms such as’ defense‘,’security'. Your advertising of minors violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. NATO is lying about the war.

  - NATO falsifies numbers and produces the enemy image, especially Russia and China. But the balance of power of the figures reveals that NATO spending on the military sector currently accounts for far more than 15 times what Russia invests in the military.

  - NATO, with the active support of Germany, is waging war all over the world - wars of intervention with devastating consequences in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Mediterranean, North and Central Africa. Germany is involved. The NATO concept under the title "Nato 2030" envisages that the boundaries between war and peace will continue to blur and the confrontation with Russia and China will be pushed to the extreme. We demand the end of all foreign missions. Bring our troops home immediately. NATO wars are also a major cause of the flight of millions. Help Yes, Frontex no. Anyone who talks about human rights must talk about refugees and Frontex operations at the borders must be stopped immediately.

  - The EU militarisation, in which the US also wants to take an active part, is aimed, among other things, at providing an infrastructure that the military demands for a war against Russia. No to the madness of a new plane with swarms of drones, which is supposed to cost 500 billion euros, no to a new tank and the euro drone. We do not need war drones, they are assault weapons – we need disarmament and civil conflict resolution. Democracy in Europe yes-militarism no.

  - We reject the purchase of combat drones, which is currently planned for more than 7 billion euros by several EU states, including Germany, as well as the arming of the Heron TP stationed in Israel-they are leap innovations on the way to the autonomization of the digital war and they violate international law through war operations without a declaration of war – with calculated collateral consequences for non – combatants. Drones are assault weapons!

  - NATO and the federal government talk so much about rule-based foreign policy: they who make and determine the rules. Mr. Maas: It's about the recognition of international law! And an end to the violations of international law: Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and so on.

#### Rearmament

When we talk about war and unrestrained armament, we have to talk about our country. A quote from our Defence Minister makes the unrestrainedness clear:

> "On average, the Bundeswehr gets a new tank every week, a new aircraft every month and a new ship every year" (figures 46.9 and 53 billion).

But let's not forget: NATO is working on an ever more perfect network of the army, the Air Force, the Navy, Internet cyber capabilities, high-tech weapons, space weapons and space control to attack enemy facilities and to ward off Internet malware-expensive and dangerous. We say no to the military bases necessary for these attack strategies. Ramstein belongs closed.

#### Nuclear weapons

It remains, a life with 14,000 nuclear weapons is the game with the nuclear downfall – Hiroshima admonishes, but politics and the powerful do not want to understand it.

A great, even historic success has been achieved: the Treaty banning all nuclear weapons is in force:

  - Over 50 states
  - Massive resistance of all nuclear powers

A first step towards common sense must be Germany's signature of the UN nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This was to be the first government action by the new federal government after 26 September.

But we also know that this treaty is binding under international law for those who have ratified it. No nuclear weapon has yet been scrapped and therefore less on the planet.

No, it's just going in the other direction: more and new nuclear weapons everywhere:

  - Trivially called "modernization", this "modernization" costs one trillion dollars in the USA alone.

  - Wes ' mind child is the policy, shows again GB Prime Minister Johnson: increase of British nuclear weapons from 180 to 240. What a provocation. Solidarity with the British peace movement.

We also reaffirm this Easter: the stationing of new nuclear arsenals (B 61-12) in Büchel, planned for 2024 at the latest, which will burden NATO budgets with immense production costs, must not come to Germany or to any other country. The thermo-nuclear bombs (B 61) stored in Büchel have to be dismantled; the ‘nuclear participation’ of Germany has to be ended accordingly, and nuclear war manoeuvres have to be prohibited. Consequently, it must not come to the purchase of 30 US F 18 nuclear bombers and also not the 90 Eurofighter, which Nato and the Luftwaffe are aiming for. According to current planning, the cost for these systems alone is over 30 billion euros for their planned service life.

Our vision remains: World without nuclear weapons, Russel Einstein Manifesto: Fight for humanity or perish! This is the challenge of these Easter marches.

#### Policy of common security and great transformation

A foreign policy that focuses instead on tensions and militarization on negotiations, international law and cooperation, as was the Ostpolitik of Egon Bahr and Willy Brandt with the Eastern Treaties and as the Palme Commission wanted with the aim of overcoming the block confrontation. Common security policy is peace policy-the basic principle of sustainable policy. The prevailing disorder of injustice, group-related misanthropy and violence, armament, wars and arms exports must be overcome through a peace policy for social-ecological justice. Capitalist and colonialist economy has brought societies to the edge of the abyss. There can be no solution with the means that have led to this situation. A transformation of the capitalist competitive system towards a society of social-ecological peace-justice means peace and justice is the vision! Social-ecological peace transformation the challenge.

  - At the same time, an active peace policy is aimed at easing Germany's relations with all European states, including Russia. Peace does not exist against, but only with Russia. Without peace with Russia there is no peace in Europe. You don't have to love Putin, but friendship with Russia shapes peace policy.

  - Without disarmament, we will achieve neither cooperation nor the provision of financial resources for global justice worldwide. The world is too small for military and armor. Disarmament also means priority for civil conflict management, conflict prevention, dialogue and diplomacy.

Environment and peace are inseparable-climate justice without peace is impossible, not only because of the insane emissions of the armies.

Where should the refugees go and this should happen peacefully?

Therefore, let us continue to work together for peace and climate justice.

It depends on the mobilization of people, of everyone for peace, whether the movements for the future can build up the pressure necessary for a great peaceful, social and ecological transformation.

Love, peace, friends and peace joy,

when I had written all this down and thought about it, I remembered another song that will be 50 years old this year. In it it says:

> Imagine all people,
> live your life in peace.
>
> You might say I'm a dreamer,
> but, I'm not the only one who dreams this.
> I hope, one day, you think so, too,
> and the whole world will be like one.

"Imagine" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, one of the most famous anti-war songs against the Vietnam War.

Yes, we will never give up the dream, the vision of a world without war and nuclear weapons, a world of global justice without exploitation and in peace with nature.

For this we are taking to the streets in the difficult conditions of the pandemic, everywhere in this republic! We do not give up! We'll be back!
