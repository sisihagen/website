For several weeks now, tensions between Ukraine and Russia have been rising massively in Donbass. Since Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj has taken a much tougher course against Russia following Joe Biden's election in the United States, illegally closed three so-called Russia-friendly television stations and openly demanded Ukraine's membership in NATO, the ceasefire violations in Luhansk and Donetsk have also risen again. And recently, the OSCE monitoring teams there have reported that the surveillance drones are hardly operational anymore due to – presumably deliberately staged – disturbances of the GPS navigation system. To motivate the pro-government Ukrainian soldiers, Selensky even personally returned to the front line. Nothing remains of his campaign promise to ensure peace in Donbass in the first place. On the contrary, he is now even pouring oil into the fire.

The media are also beginning to report on this visible escalation and the new, increased threat of war. Above all, they report on major Russian troop movements near the Donbas border – and, as expected, they interpret and comment on them as Russian provocation and preparation for a new arms race.

What the media do not report on, or even mention in a subordinate clause: NATO is now carrying out the great Defender-Europe 21 maneuvers, again at the Russian border in 2020. The NATO Defender-Europe 20 maneuvers were announced at the time as the largest maneuvers since the end of the Cold War. In addition to the USA, several NATO countries were involved, including Germany, of course. 20’000 soldiers were flown in from the USA, another 17’000 came from other NATO countries. The maneuvers were to take place according to strategy in Poland and the Baltic states, i.e. purposefully and demonstratively at the Russian border. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they had to be cancelled prematurely.

#### Defender-Europe 21 again at the Russian border

Now the new NATO maneuvers called Defender-Europe 21 are underway. Announced – for example, in the "army times" – 28.000 armed forces from 27 countries. This time, Ukraine, Georgia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Moldova and Kosovo, which are not (yet) members of NATO, will also be involved. Special emphasis will be placed on the training of NATO leaders. And this time, too, NATO maneuvers are taking place on the Russian border, this time not in the European North, but in the south: "DEFENDER-Europe 21 offers us the best opportunity to sharpen our capabilities alongside our allies and partners in the strategically important Balkan and Black Sea region, so that we are jointly ready to respond to any crisis that may arise."

> "WIESBADEN, Germany-The activities of DEFENDER-Europe 21 start this month throughout Europe and last until June.

> DEFENDER-Europe is an annual, large-scale, multi-national, joint exercise led by the US Army in Europe and Africa to improve strategic and operational readiness and interoperability between the US, NATO allies and partners.

> Building on the success of last year's exercise, DEFENDER-Europe 21 includes a larger number of NATO allies and partner nations carrying out activities over a larger area than was planned for 2020. More than 28,000 multinational forces from 26 nations will conduct almost simultaneous operations in more than 30 training areas in a dozen countries.

DEFENDER-Europe 21 will include several related exercises, including:

  - Swift Response (early to mid-May) - will include airborne operations in Estonia, Bulgaria and Romania, involving more than 7,000 soldiers from 11 countries.

  - Immediate Response (mid-May to early June) - more than 5,000 soldiers from 8 countries will be spread over 31 training areas in 12 different countries to conduct live fire training. A joint Logistics Over-the-Shore operation will also take place.

  - Saber Guardian (mid-May to early June) - more than 13,000 soldiers from 19 countries carry out shooting, air and missile defense exercises, as well as a large-scale medical evacuation.

  - Stand-by exercise (June) - approximately 2,000 personnel will train Headquarters ' ability to command multinational land forces in a common and combined training environment, while conducting real-world operations in 104 countries on two continents."

Not a word about the gigantic NATO maneuvers on the Russian border.

And so on and so on.

One cannot avoid drawing one conclusion from this: the Western media not only provide information, but also, above all, engage in anti-Russia opinion-making.
