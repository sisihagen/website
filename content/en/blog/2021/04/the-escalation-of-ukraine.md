As we know, the year 2021 brings nothing new. The same chatter of the media, that disgusting stammering of political leaders and Ukraine is beginning to prepare for the major offensive. The already problems apart from nationalists have to get" ammunition walls " and therefore introduced the conscription again.

Let's chronoligically record the escalations, so that you can see at the end why the German media will not report about it until you can blame everything on Russia.

#### The situation in Donbass

On November 9, 2020, the OSCE published a [report](/static/downloads/469734.pdf "CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF EASTERN UKRAINE") stating that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are responsible for 75% of civilian casualties from January 2017 to September 2020. In Germany you can not find the voices of this report.

Corrupt and dementia sufferer Joe Biden is elected president of the American dictatorship and is given by Selensky [sanctions and closure](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10617021 "В ЕС оценивают последствия санкций Киева против телеканалов") by Russian-speaking media in Ukraine.

It was then confirmed by the American [Embassy](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10616161 "США поддержали решение Зеленского по введению санкций против украинских телеканалов") in Ukraine that the freedom of opinion and press only applies to the extent that they are in common with American opinion.

> "The US supports efforts to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with its laws, which Ukraine took yesterday to counter Russia's malevolent influence. We must all work together to prevent misinformation being used as a weapon in the information war against sovereign states."

Selenski defended the whole thing on Twitter and of course the whole thing in English and not in the national language for which he actually speaks.

The Ukrainian Defense Minister met with the Osama Bin Laden of the West Jens Stoltenberg of the terrorist organization NATO. He assured the strengthening of the [presence](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10667129 "Киев предложил НАТО использовать воздушное пространство над Крымом для операций альянса") in the Black Sea because it is supposedly so strategically important there. So speaks a real terrorist. He cannot justify his existence, but he considers himself important.

Like the Georgian idiot in the 5 day fun shooting 2008 one has asked the big face to have the support around the big face. This reminds of my dachshund who liked to turn on the big dogs and when they came closer hid behind me.

> "Taking into account the updated EASA aviation safety bulletin in the Simferopol flight information region and the lifting of US Federal Aviation Administration restrictions on flights into Simferopol airspace, we propose to use this part of the airspace for NATO air operations for the transport of troops, equipment, cargo and the like. We hope to support NATO in monitoring the situation in the airspace along the border with Russia"

There are different views on the status of Crimea. The fact is that those in Crimea have decided and for the ideology of the Ukrainians, who have never considered the island important and treated it accordingly, there is no need for the risk of a third world War, which in the end means the extinction of the people on this planet. Crimea is Russian airspace and anyone who violates it must live with the consequences!

In Ukraine it is no longer the government that decides on laws, the comedian has already handed over this violence to the National Security Council. The requested what the comedian Selensky then by [Deskret](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10753411 "Зеленский ввел в действие решение СНБО о санкциях против Медведчука и других граждан") shall adopt. Sanctions, for example, also against their own [opposition](https://smotrim.ru/article/2526328 "СНБО ввел санкции против Медведчука, его жены и россиян"), which of course does not lead to any protest in German media and the Nato troll Heiko Maas.

#### 25. Februar 2021

Without opposition, of course, corresponding TV stations are also obsolete and so people use the Internet to obtain information. This is of course bad for the fascists in Kiev, également 426 [Internet sites](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10780711 "На Украине заблокируют более 400 сайтов, включая LiveJournal и РБК") are blocked. Aufschrei en Allemagne, from the troll Heiko Maas?

#### 26. February 2021

The Ukrainian secret service SBU has had the [party office](https://www.vesti.ru/article/2528808 "Игра в диктатора: Зеленский натравил СБУ на офис партии Медведчука") of the opposition leader Medventchuk searched.

Kiev, of course, an American errand boy and cannon fodder the chief ideologists of the Pentagon and Nato have also begun to discriminate against China. This is the thing of the Ukrainian, minorities, foreign cultures are against Him. Then a law will be passed that justifies the corresponding [expropriations](https://www.vesti.ru/finance/article/2532047 "Украина национализирует Мотор Сич, китайские инвесторы могут потерять $3,6 млрд"). How nice that China can shit on Ukraine.

#### 10. March 2021

The Minsk Agreement is [buried](https://www.ukrinform.ru/rubric-polytics/3205045-ermak-o-situacii-na-donbasse-plan-mira-lezit-na-stole.html "Ермак - о ситуации на Донбассе: План мира лежит на столе").

#### 11. March 2021

Ukraine talks openly about breaking the ceasefire. Nato should of course stand by its side and thus open the [war against Russia](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10884493 "Украина заявила о желании занять должности в штабе НАТО и командных структурах альянса").

#### 13. March 2021

As you can see from the leaders and speakers in Ukraine, the same drugs are circulating there as those of Stoltenberg and Maas like to be thrown in. Ukraine is funnier, they make one more on Grimm and tell something about a [peace plan in Donbas](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10898233 "Кравчук не исключает вероятность масштабного конфликта в Донбассе") while the bitter old Leonid Kravchuk dreams of the great war.

#### 1 April 2021

The terrorist state of the USA is of course on the rise and not a day goes by without a report of Russian aggression. Due to the danger of war, men are now being drafted for the fight in Donbas as well. The danger of war can also be seen in the fact that the media like the [Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-usa-verurteilen-aggressives-vorgehen-russland-entlang-der-grenze-a-317785a1-98cc-43d6-b34f-29aa05624aa9 "USA verurteilen "aggressives" Vorgehen Moskaus im Ukrainekonflikt") has rediscovered Ukraine and is simply taking over the propaganda.
