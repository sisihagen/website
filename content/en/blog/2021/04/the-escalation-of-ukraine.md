As we know, the year 2021 brings nothing new. The same chatter of the media, that disgusting stammering of political leaders and Ukraine is beginning to prepare for the major offensive. The already problems apart from nationalists have to get" ammunition walls " and therefore introduced the conscription again.

Let's chronoligically record the escalations, so that you can see at the end why the German media will not report about it until you can blame everything on Russia.

#### The situation in Donbass

On November 9, 2020, the OSCE published a [report](/static/downloads/469734.pdf "CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED REGIONS OF EASTERN UKRAINE") stating that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are responsible for 75% of civilian casualties from January 2017 to September 2020. In Germany you can not find the voices of this report.

#### February 2, 2021

Corrupt and dementia sufferer Joe Biden is elected president of the American dictatorship and is given by Selensky [sanctions and closure](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10617021 "В ЕС оценивают последствия санкций Киева против телеканалов") by Russian-speaking media in Ukraine.

It was then confirmed by the American [Embassy](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10616161 "США поддержали решение Зеленского по введению санкций против украинских телеканалов") in Ukraine that the freedom of opinion and press only applies to the extent that they are in common with American opinion.

> "The US supports efforts to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with its laws, which Ukraine took yesterday to counter Russia's malevolent influence. We must all work together to prevent misinformation being used as a weapon in the information war against sovereign states."

Selenski defended the whole thing on Twitter and of course the whole thing in English and not in the national language for which he actually speaks.

#### February 9, 2021

The Ukrainian Defense Minister met with the Osama Bin Laden of the West Jens Stoltenberg of the terrorist organization NATO. He assured the strengthening of the [presence](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10667129 "Киев предложил НАТО использовать воздушное пространство над Крымом для операций альянса") in the Black Sea because it is supposedly so strategically important there. So speaks a real terrorist. He cannot justify his existence, but he considers himself important.

Like the Georgian idiot in the 5 day fun shooting 2008 one has asked the big face to have the support around the big face. This reminds of my dachshund who liked to turn on the big dogs and when they came closer hid behind me.

> "Taking into account the updated EASA aviation safety bulletin in the Simferopol flight information region and the lifting of US Federal Aviation Administration restrictions on flights into Simferopol airspace, we propose to use this part of the airspace for NATO air operations for the transport of troops, equipment, cargo and the like. We hope to support NATO in monitoring the situation in the airspace along the border with Russia"

There are different views on the status of Crimea. The fact is that those in Crimea have decided and for the ideology of the Ukrainians, who have never considered the island important and treated it accordingly, there is no need for the risk of a third world War, which in the end means the extinction of the people on this planet. Crimea is Russian airspace and anyone who violates it must live with the consequences!

#### February 19, 2021

In Ukraine it is no longer the government that decides on laws, the comedian has already handed over this violence to the National Security Council. The requested what the comedian Selensky then by [Deskret](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10753411 "Зеленский ввел в действие решение СНБО о санкциях против Медведчука и других граждан") shall adopt. Sanctions, for example, also against their own [opposition](https://smotrim.ru/article/2526328 "СНБО ввел санкции против Медведчука, его жены и россиян"), which of course does not lead to any protest in German media and the Nato troll Heiko Maas.

#### Februar 25, 2021

Without opposition, of course, corresponding TV stations are also obsolete and so people use the Internet to obtain information. This is of course bad for the fascists in Kiev, également 426 [Internet sites](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10780711 "На Украине заблокируют более 400 сайтов, включая LiveJournal и РБК") are blocked. Aufschrei en Allemagne, from the troll Heiko Maas?

#### February 26, 2021

The Ukrainian secret service SBU has had the [party office](https://www.vesti.ru/article/2528808 "Игра в диктатора: Зеленский натравил СБУ на офис партии Медведчука") of the opposition leader Medventchuk searched.

#### March 4, 2021

Kiev, of course, an American errand boy and cannon fodder the chief ideologists of the Pentagon and Nato have also begun to discriminate against China. This is the thing of the Ukrainian, minorities, foreign cultures are against Him. Then a law will be passed that justifies the corresponding [expropriations](https://www.vesti.ru/finance/article/2532047 "Украина национализирует Мотор Сич, китайские инвесторы могут потерять $3,6 млрд"). How nice that China can shit on Ukraine.

#### March 10, 2021

The Minsk Agreement is [buried](https://www.ukrinform.ru/rubric-polytics/3205045-ermak-o-situacii-na-donbasse-plan-mira-lezit-na-stole.html "Ермак - о ситуации на Донбассе: План мира лежит на столе").

#### 11. March 2021

Ukraine talks openly about breaking the ceasefire. Nato should of course stand by its side and thus open the [war against Russia](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10884493 "Украина заявила о желании занять должности в штабе НАТО и командных структурах альянса").

#### March 13, 2021

As you can see from the leaders and speakers in Ukraine, the same drugs are circulating there as those of Stoltenberg and Maas like to be thrown in. Ukraine is funnier, they make one more on Grimm and tell something about a [peace plan in Donbas](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/10898233 "Кравчук не исключает вероятность масштабного конфликта в Донбассе") while the bitter old Leonid Kravchuk dreams of the great war.

#### April 1, 2021

The terrorist state of the USA is of course on the rise and not a day goes by without a report of Russian aggression. Due to the danger of war, men are now being drafted for the fight in Donbas as well. The danger of war can also be seen in the fact that the media like the [Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-usa-verurteilen-aggressives-vorgehen-russland-entlang-der-grenze-a-317785a1-98cc-43d6-b34f-29aa05624aa9 "USA verurteilen aggressives Vorgehen Moskaus im Ukrainekonflikt") has rediscovered Ukraine and is simply taking over the propaganda.

#### April 3, 2021

Leonid Kravchuk, once president of Ukraine, now stands out only because of the Western school. No [diplomacy](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11063055 "Кравчук назвал Украину врагом России") just chatter.

> And only now, last month, it became obvious to the US and the West that no collusion can be made with Russia.

Also interesting is [Alexei Arestovich](https://smotrim.ru/article/2545711 "Украина заявила о подготовке НАТО к войне с Россией") who once translated the reason for the NATO Defender Europe terror training:

> "Defender Europe 2021 means "Protect Europe". The sense is that from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea – well, let's face it – the war against Russia is practiced, the armed confrontation with Russia is trained

The primary school student and appointed [Minister of War](https://de.rt.com/inland/115373-kramp-karrenbauer-russland-sehr-greifbare-bedrohung/ "Kramp-Karrenbauer: Russland ist für uns eine sehr greifbare Bedrohung") AKK demands of course due to the threat of Russia once more money for the killer troop.

#### April 5, 2021

Josep Borrell agrees with the chorus and [assures](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-konflikt-eu-aussenbeauftragter-josep-borrell-sichert-hilfe-zu-a-7109b7d2-29c1-4e0d-b79f-a51770d09917 "EU-Außenbeauftragter versichert Ukraine Unterstützung") the "unwavering EU support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.".

Of course, the US is allowed to interfere once again what Ned Price is doing, Tass sums it up as follows:

> "According to him, Russia's actions are undermining" the de-escalation of tensions by the agreement reached in July last year under the mediation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe."At the same time, the US State Department spokesman expressed the view that Russia's recent deployment of military units on its own territory was provocative. "We have asked Russia to provide an explanation for these provocations," said the American Diplomat. "However, it is more important," Price said, " that we (the US government) have given a direct signal of support to the Ukrainian partners.""In addition to our assurances to Ukrainian officials, we are discussing our concerns about growing tensions, violations of the ceasefire and regional tensions with NATO allies," Price added. He clarified that the issue had been discussed last week at NATO headquarters in Brussels."

#### April 6, 2021

The Osama bin Laden Jens Stoltenberg as representative of the [terrorist organization](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-konflikt-nato-warnt-russland-vor-eskalation-an-der-grenze-a-bfa8dc9b-46b7-4a46-9a1d-1e3d38f10895  "Nato warnt Russland vor Eskalation in der Ukraine") warns Russia:

> Nato will continue to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We remain vigilant and continue to monitor the situation very closely," a NATO spokesman told Die Welt. Russia's destabilizing measures would undermine any efforts to de-escalate tensions under the OSCE-brokered cease-fire agreement of mid-2020.

Leonid Kravchuk the head of the Ukrainian contact group [appealed](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11077865 "Кравчук запросил экстренную встречу контактной группы из-за ситуации в Донбассе") to the OSCE a meeting should be called to discuss a ceasefire. Peace in Ukraine? Far from it, a meeting is already scheduled for April 14 and Kravchuk said on Ukrainian [TV](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11083637 "Кравчук заявил, что Украина больше не согласится ехать в Минск на переговоры по Донбассу") that Ukraine will not participate in the meeting should take place in Minsk.

The puppet, the comedian Selensky talked with Osama Bin Laden about [joining](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11077931 "Зеленский считает, что членство Украины в НАТО приведет к окончанию войны в Донбассе") NATO.

> We want to reform our army and defense sector, but Russia cannot be stopped by reforms alone. NATO is the only way to end the war in Donbass. The NATO action Plan for membership will be a real signal for Russia.

#### April 7th, 2021

On April 7, the Ukrainian [Defense Ministry](https://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2021/04/07/odin-za-vsih-i-vsi-za-odnogo-u-2021-mu-roczi-ukraina-doluchatimetsya-do-nizki-navchan-nato-za-statteyu-5-kolektivna-oborona-%E2%80%93-andrij-taran/ "Один за всіх і всі за одного: у 2021-му році Україна долучатиметься до низки навчань НАТО за статтею 5 Колективна оборона, – Андрій Таран") announced that Ukraine would be invited to participate in seven NATO maneuvers in 2021:

> "Among the exercises to which the North Atlantic Alliance has invited Ukraine are Steadfast Cobalt, Ramstein Apex, Ramstein Ambition, Steadfast Defender, Noble Bonus, Steadfast Jupiter, Steadfast Leda"

{{< image_new picture="2021/027" title="Militärattaché Stewart wear Ukraine Clothes with Nationalism Sign" >}}

#### April 8, 2021

Selensky visited the media contact line. The visit serves the propaganda of the presidential office. After all, the comedian has reached the popularity values of herpes and so it can be shown what a great pike the comedian is. The Russian [television](https://vesti7.ru/video/2287137/episode/11-04-2021/ "ЭФИР ОТ 11.04.2021") showed the pictures and of course quoted the chatter:

> "Those in power in Ukraine should be in Donbass, which is very important. First, for the soldiers, so that they understand that the government is not hiding in offices, but is where it is really difficult, where, frankly, real heroes decide the fate of Ukraine and protect its borders. No one can work in high offices if there is no one to protect the borders"

That it was propaganda can be seen in the pictures. The comedian walks around wearing a helmet and a bulletproof vest while the others were wearing "leisure clothes".

{{< image_new picture="2021/028" title="Comedian Selensky the Hero of Ukrainian fascists" >}}

#### April 9, 2021

The show of a comedian does not end after one day. Selensky is no exception, the brave hero of the Ukrainian fascists has in a [barracks](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11108243 "Зеленский провел ночь в Донбассе в расположении подразделений ВСУ").

On this Day of Heroes, according to the Treaty of Montreux, the United States has announced the sailing of two [warships](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11107297 "США уведомили Турцию, что на следующей неделе два военных корабля пройдут через Босфор") into the Black Sea. The treaty regulates the passage of all ships that must be reported to Turkey.

With so much fascism, nationalism and ideology one can of course forget to take note of reports of the Ukrainian media. According to a survey in Ukraine, 70% of the opinion [Ukraine](http://ratinggroup.ua/ru/research/ukraine/obschestvenno-politicheskie_nastroeniya_naseleniya_6-7_aprelya_2021.html "ОБЩЕСТВЕННО-ПОЛИТИЧЕСКИЕ НАСТРОЕНИЯ НАСЕЛЕНИЯ") is moving in the wrong direction.

#### 12. April 2021

But now [Ukraine](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11129053 "Киев заявил о необходимости его практической поддержки на случай вооруженного обострения") is finally demanding action from NATO.

> "We all need to understand that a phase may come when expressed concern will not be enough. We must now talk about what support there can be in practice for Ukraine in the event of a large-scale armed escalation. The most important thing now is: first, to give Russia maximum signals that any armed escalation directed against Ukraine will have serious consequences for Russia, and also to enumerate the concrete consequences. Second: the defense capability of Ukraine, strengthen our armed forces, also through cooperation with our partners. Thirdly, the closest possible cooperation between our intelligence services and those of our partners, especially from NATO countries and with Nato as a whole, so that we fully understand Russia's intentions"

The comedian Seleknsky, hero of the Ukrainian nationalists, demands more than just [words](https://www.vesti.ru/article/2549822 "Зеленский: Украине мало слов Байдена, нужны действия") from Biden.

#### April 13, 2021

The Ukrainian secret service proudly announces that it now wants to start a great maneuver on the [border](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11136715 "В Харьковской области на границе с Россией пройдут масштабные антитеррористические учения") with Russia.

> "On April 14, the SBU in Kharkiv will begin with multi-stage anti-terror maneuvers. The maneuvers will take place until the end of May throughout the Kharkiv region, with a focus on the border areas."

National Guard units and corresponding [SS battalions](https://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/enacaregion/pages/uareports.aspx "Ukraine - OHCHR Reports") also take part in the maneuvers. The whole thing is of course not a war maneuver, but according to Ukrainian thinking an anti-terror fight. This also explains why Ukrainian citizens in Donbas do not get a passport and the Crimea is immediately turned off the water and electricity. This is the Guantanamo / Abu-Ghuraib method of the USA!

Russia is strengthening the tone, especially with regard to the American warships. The [Deputy](https://de.rt.com/russland/115839-moskau-fordert-washington-auf-sich-von-der-krim-fernzuhalten/ "Moskau: US-Kriegsschiffe sollten sich von der Krim und der russischen Schwarzmeerküste fernhalten") Russian foreign Minister Ryabkov:

> "The US needs to understand that the risks of certain incidents are very high. We have already observed something similar this year in a completely different sea area. We warn the United States that it is better for them to stay away from Crimea, from our Black Sea coast. It will be for your own good."

With a view to a possible escalation in Donbass [he added](https://de.rt.com/europa/115892-russlands-stellvertretender-aussenminister-kundigt-konsequenzen-eskalation-donbass-an/ "Russlands stellvertretender Außenminister kündigt Konsequenzen bei Eskalation im Donbass an") to the addresses of NATO and USA:

> "Should there be a tightening of any kind, we will of course do everything to guarantee our own safety and the safety of our citizens wherever they are. But the responsibility for the consequences of such an intensification will lie entirely with Kiev and its supporters in the West."

#### April 14, 2021

Of course, Ukrainian intelligence will also conduct a maneuver near [Crimea](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11150173 "Украина проводит антитеррористические учения вблизи границы с Крымом").

> "The SBU is conducting large-scale multi-stage anti-terror maneuvers in the Kherson region. During the maneuvers special attention will be paid to the coast of the region as well as the borders with Crimea. ( ... ) The maneuvers take place under conditions that come as close as possible to reality. During the maneuvers, strategically important critical infrastructure facilities in the Kherson region will be increasingly controlled and protected. The focus is on seaports, power plants, airports, bridges and gas production towers."

#### April 15, 2021

The US has understood the threat from Russia and is not moving any [warships](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/u-s-cancels-deployment-of-two-warships-to-black-sea "U.S. Cancels Deployment of Warships to Black Sea, Turkey Says") into the Black Sea. The Kremlin commented on this by saying it is not yet [relaxing](https://smotrim.ru/article/2550881 "Кремль: отказ США отправить корабли в Черное море еще не говорит о разрядке") the situation.

In Ukraine there seem to be even [realists](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11157133 "Кравчук считает сказочниками тех, кто ждет помощи американских солдат на Украине"). According to Leonid Kravchuk, head of the Ukrainian delegation at the Minsk talks:

> Who expects that tomorrow American soldiers will come to Ukraine and protect us is a storyteller. This will not happen.

But then again, the troll is not that realistic. Of course, the US and the EU support us with anti-Russian sanctions.

The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany once again calls for admission to NATO. Otherwise, Ukraine wants to build [nuclear weapons](https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-botschafter-droht-mit-atomarer-aufruestung-a-de71361f-d7f6-40fb-a62c-99b8aaa172da "Ukrainischer Botschafter droht mit atomarer Aufrüstung"). How awesome ideology and atom weapons. Above all, one wonders what the bankrupt state wants to pay for this? Above all, where does the jerk live? The American errand boy gets atom weapons.

#### April 16, 2021

The Ukrainian president is a [comedian](https://www.vesti.ru/finance/article/2551377 "Президент Украины назвал Северный поток-2 вопросом войны") what you see more clearly in his chatter than in his person.

> "As in any war, you cannot fight if there is no unity. Someone will surely lose. If "Nord Stream 2" is completed, not only Ukraine will lose. We must not forget that this is not a question of the Russian and European economies. No, this is a question of war"

The Russian Foreign Ministry in the person of Maria Zakharova responded and kindly reminded the Ukrainian trolls what an [energy war](https://smotrim.ru/article/2551573 "Захарова рассказала Зеленскому о настоящей энергетической войне") is. Ukraine separated Crimea from electricity and water in 2014 and in 2015 under criminal Poroshenko had to commit [attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/8/10/russia-ukraine-terrorist-attacks-in-crimea-foiled "Russia: Ukraine ‘terrorist attacks’ in Crimea foiled") on the supply of Ukraine, which the Russian secret service prevented.

The federal reaction pressed ahead with a response to the [announcement](https://de.rt.com/inland/116116-ukraine-fordert-nato-mitgliedschaft-oder/ "Ukraine stellt Ultimatum: NATO-Mitgliedschaft oder atomare Bewaffnung – Was sagt Bundesregierung?") of the Ukrainian ambassador Ukraine wanted to have nuclear weapons. Perhaps the American errand boys are already protesting in Washingtom. If Ukraine can have some then we want some.

The US has [confirmed](https://www.vesti.ru/article/2551583 "США могут увеличить военный контингент на Украине") that American soldiers are in Ukraine. In a message, it was literally spoken of" moving more troops". Since you should ask yourself who is escalating here.

#### April 17, 2021

In St. Petersburg, a Ukrainian [diplomat](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11178545 "Украина высылает старшего дипломата посольства России в Киеве") was arrested while trying to buy secret information. Russia has ordered the immediate expulsion, Kiev of course reacts in the same way and Germany, despite official confirmation from both countries, tells of Russian allegations.

#### April 18, 2021

The US does not send ships there are the European idiots who are active in NATO. The [island monkeys](https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/ausland/internationale-politik/id_89865812/konflikt-in-der-ukraine-grossbritannien-schickt-zerstoerer-ins-schwarze-meer.html "Großbritannien schickt Zerstörer ins Schwarze Meer") are now sending two destroyers into the Black Sea.

#### April 19, 2021

Austria has spoken out against new [sanctions](https://www.puls24.at/news/politik/oesterreich-spricht-sich-gegen-sanktionen-fuer-russland-aus/232191 "Österreich spricht sich gegen Sanktionen für Russland aus"). But the Russian-phobic gossip in Brussels goes on, of course. Borrel, of course, knows how many soldiers Russia has deployed along the Ukrainian border. The competition who reports more is opened in the West.

Ukraine now wants to crack down hard and break diplomatic [relations](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/11189761 "Фракция Зеленского в Раде потребовала расторжения дипотношений с Россией") with Russia. The requirement was introduced in the Rada, together with the mobilization of reservists. Europe can rejoice when the pipeline is ready, then the people of Europe will no longer feed the Ukrainian clowns through.
