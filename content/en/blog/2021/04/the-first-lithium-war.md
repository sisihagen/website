Remember the overthrow of Bolivian President Evo Morales at the end of 2019, when the ruling press claimed that he had turned his country into a dictatorship and had just been driven out by his people.  The Organization of American States (OAS) published a report in which it confirmed that the elections had been rigged and that the restoration of democracy was under way.

But President Morales, fearing to end up like Chilean President Salvador Allende, fled to Mexico and denounced a coup organized to rob the country's lithium reserves. But since he could not identify the clients, he only caused sarcasm in the West. Only we have announced that the operation was carried out by a community of Croatian Ustasha Catholics present in the country since the end of World War II in Santa Cruz; a stay-behind network of NATO.

A year later, the party of President Morales won new elections by a large majority. There was no protest and he was able to return triumphantly to his country. His alleged dictatorship had never existed, while that of Jeanine Áñez had just been overthrown by the ballot boxes.

Historian Mark Curtis and journalist Matt Kennard had access to declassified Foreign Office documents they were studying. They published their conclusions on the website Declassified UK, which has been based in [South Africa](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-03-08-revealed-the-uk-supported-the-coup-in-bolivia-to-gain-access-to-its-white-gold/ "The UK supported the coup in Bolivia to gain access to its ‘white gold’") since its military censorship in the UK.

Throughout his work, Mark Curtis has shown that the policy of the United Kingdom has been little changed by decolonization. We had cited his work in dozens of Voltaire network articles.

It turned out that the overthrow of President Morales was an order from the Foreign Office UK Foreign Office and CIA elements that had detached themselves from the Trump administration. The aim was to steal the country's lithium, which is coveted by the United Kingdom in connection with the energy transition.

The Obama administration had already attempted a coup in 2009, which was put down by President Morales, which led to the expulsion of several American diplomats and officials. The Trump administration, on the other hand, apparently gave the Neoconservatives in Latin America free rein, but systematically prevented them from implementing their plans.

Lithium is a component of modern batteries. It is found mainly in the salt-the salt deserts of the high plateau, "Salar" is called, in the mountains of Chile, Argentina, and especially in Bolivia (the "lithium triangle"), and even in Tibet. But also in stony form in some minerals extracted from mines, especially in Australia. It is essential for switching from petrol cars to electric vehicles. Lithium has therefore become a more important challenge than oil as a result of the Paris Agreement to Combat global warming.

In February 2019, President Evo Morales granted a Chinese company, TBEA Group, permission to operate its country's main lithium reserves. So the UK has come up with a plan to steal it.

Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian, became president of Bolivia in 2006. He represented the coca producers; a local plant indispensable for life at high altitude, but also a powerful drug banned in the world by the U.S. virtue leagues. His election and governance marked the return of the Indians to power, who had been excluded from power since the Spanish colonial period.

  - Already in 2017-18, the United Kingdom has sent experts to the Bolivian National Company Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) to examine the conditions for the operation of the Bolivian lithium.

  - In 2019-20, London sponsored a study on "Optimizing the research and production of Bolivian lithium with British technology".

  - In April 2019, the United Kingdom Embassy in Buenos Aires hosted a seminar with representatives from Argentina, Chile and Bolivia, representatives of mining companies and governments to present the benefits of using the London Metal Exchange. The Morales administration was represented there by one of its ministers.

  - Immediately after the coup d'état, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) proved to be the financier of the British projects.

  - Long before the coup d'état, the Foreign Office had forced an Oxford company, Satellite Applications Catapult, to draw up a map of lithium reserves. It was paid by the IADB only after the overthrow of President Morales.

  - A few months later, the British Embassy in La Paz organised a seminar for 300 industry players with the support of Watchman UK. This office is specialized in involving the population in projects that violate their interests and to prevent their revolt.

Before and after the coup, the British embassy in Bolivia neglected the capital, La Paz, to take a special interest in the area of Santa Cruz, where the Ustasha Croats had come to power legally. It multiplied cultural and commercial events there.

To neutralize the Bolivian banks, the British embassy in La Paz organized a seminar on computer security eight months before the coup. The diplomats introduced the company DarkTrace (which was founded by the British Homeland Security Service) and declared that only banks that use it for their security would be able to work with the city.

According to Mark Curtis and Matthew Kennard, the U.S. did not participate in the conspiracy as such, but officials left the CIA to prepare it. So DarkTrace recruited Marcus Fowler, a specialist in CIA cyber operations, and especially Alan Wade, the former head of intelligence. Most of the operation's personnel were British, including those in charge of Watchman UK, Christopher Goodwin-Hudson (former professional soldier, later security director of Goldman-Sachs) and Gabriel Carter (member of the very private Special Forces Club in Knightsbridge, which has excelled in Afghanistan).

The historian and the journalist further affirm that the British embassy provides the OAS Organization of American States with data that served as "evidence" of vote rigging; report refuted by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) before the data was refuted by the Bolivians themselves in the following elections.

Contemporary events prove Mark Curtis ’work as a historian right. Thus, in three years, since the coup in Bolivia (2019), we have shown London's role in the Yemen War (2020) and the Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020).

The UK conducts brief wars and covert operations, if possible, without the media reporting on its actions. It controls itself the perception of its presence through a variety of press and media agencies, which it secretly subsidizes. It creates uncontrollable living conditions for those who are targeted. It uses them to exploit the land to its advantage. Moreover, it can keep this situation going as long as possible, as it is certain that its victims will still appeal to the United Kingdom, which alone is able to defuse the conflict it has created itself.
