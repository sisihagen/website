When looking at all that whips us daily in the gazettes of the digital flood of information, it should be assumed that, at least in the case of one or the other event that excites the mind, something from the historical background should be brought in to explain it. But, this must be conceded, if it uses its own point of view, then certainly, if it endangers its own evaluation, then the historical Dimension is simply hidden. This could end in a desperate scolding from the media, but perhaps it is also a Symptom of the Times.

In addition to the historical ignorance that undoubtedly prevails everywhere, although the sources have never been so easily accessible, there is often a lack of conviction that something can be explained by looking at history.

Be that as it may, the propagated end of history with the year 1991, which the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama propagated after the collapse of the Soviet Union, logically began by renouncing knowledge and interpretation of history, at least in the general education accessible in public schools. Today, in times of the hurricane-like spread of horror stories and mystic world interpretation and the resulting boom of demagogues(link is external), this gap is sometimes lamented. Mostly, in a short respite between successive technocratic action plans in the Staccato, only to fall back into familiar ways when the next control lamps flash. Politically, however, the damage can no longer be quantified â€“ and it will still grow.

#### The liquidation of history

The political actors can often no longer be outdone in the abstruseness of their Argumentation. There are sentences to be heard in which the Second World War with its main aggressor and its conquerors is completely rewritten. Then Britain suddenly becomes the protecting power of democracy in Hong Kong and China is expelled as a traditionally aggressive imperialist power. In the good old school, which of course never existed, this alliterate chatter would have helped at best to an insufficient Note, but perhaps also to a reference. Today, these stupidities resound from the mouths of Supreme mandate and dignitaries.

O tempora, o mores, one might say and lament the decay of mores. But this is not so. It is about the purposefully staged liquidation of historical knowledge in the collective consciousness of domination, because it could quickly lead to the fact that the actions of the powerful are questioned with Justice and justice, and all the nonsense with which the domination and especially its aggressive variant are justified to the outside world would collapse like a house of Cards.

Therefore, it is necessary and important to present history as what it is. As a sequence of episodes of all sorts of trials and tribulations that can be explained by certain social needs, by archetypal patterns of striving for Power(Link is external) and maintaining power, and as a hodgepodge of human predispositions that, favored by certain structures, come into their own. That's exciting, that's worth considering, and that always encourages people to think about the here and now. That's not much, but it's quite enough to escape the amoeba-like everyday rush of the Daily fairy lights of needs and look into the depth of the room. And, after all, it's always about space and time. [Escaping fate](https://www.textlog.de/benjamin-schicksal-charakter.html "Schicksal und Charakter") we do not, however forcibly we hide what has happened. It doesn't get better, it gets different. And the best must be made of it.
