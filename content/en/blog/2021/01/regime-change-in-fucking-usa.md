"Such images from another country-and it would only be a matter of time before the Americans invade to bring peace and democracy to the country." With this sentence, Christian Ehring, in his satire show  "Extra 3" on Thursday evening on German television ARD, summed up the events of the past few days in Washington as aptly as ironically. His broadcasting vessel is also called "the madness of the week". And the images of violence that the US has sown since its existence would not have been better suited under any title.

#### "Regimechange has come home"

While reporters, correspondents and commentators in the global media Mainstream were still struggling in rows for words and "could not believe" "what they saw," Ehring had immediately grasped the irony of the matter and the background of the events: for decades, U.S. leaders of both parties had made clear to the people of their country-and demonstrated that and how to overthrow or prevent unwelcome governments by force, and even must. This was especially true when it came to" communist Regimes." And for the Hawks in Washington," communists "or even" terrorists " were and are almost everyone who does not want to dance to their tune.

Now Trump's violent and sometimes well-armed "Proud Boys" and tens of thousands of their followers showed that they have learned this lesson. Why not: the "fucking democrats", who were just about to take power in the country again, are for them also"fucking communists". Republicans of all shades had distinguished this across the country among their "Trump"baseball caps, since the election victory of Democrat Joe Biden in all TV cameras and radio microphones incessantly complained. What's more, these Democrats are also fraudsters who "stole" Trump's election victory (and behind him 74 million US Citizens). However, they had to intervene, "intervene" – if necessary also "robust". Violent change of government (or its forced Prevention) now stop in your own country: Regimechange has come home.

#### Who habitually experiences violence…

Because: if " to take down communist governments "is right and necessary by force in the wide world (be they elected or not), why not even more so when these" Communists "are about to"seize" power in their own country? And the false pretext of "electoral fraud" for "Intervention" in the Capitol, which has been repeated millions of times, is also fatally reminiscent of earlier "reasons" for violence interventions that were lied to at the highest US level-from "Restore democracy in Kuwait" to "Weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq.

In short: small, local violent offenders imitated the larger, nobler but no less rabid global violent offenders at the head of their state. For decades, the leaders in Washington have repeatedly wanted to "solve" "problems" worldwide (from Vietnam to Chile to Panama or Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria) with violence and war, which they thought were theirs. Now they are terrified and outraged that this violence, which has become almost a habit in foreign policy, suddenly overtakes them in the center of power in the USA – and falls back on them. The clever, German TV satirist Christian Ehring was little surprised by this" madness of the week".
