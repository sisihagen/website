If one believes the appearance that presents itself, we live in an age of conspiracy theories. In order to get a true picture, it is first of all necessary to deal with where the inflationary term actually comes from.

#### It's about the principle

Unfortunately, it is the case that in its origin it comes from contexts that prove one thing very clearly: a conspiracy theory was usually described etymologically as an attempt to describe and explain actually drastic conditions. And it was used by those who had something to hide. And, whether one wants it or not, in the early days of its boom, the term appeared when intelligence agencies in a special way seized the American CIA, when they felt exposed.

That not everything that wants to describe incredible events is free from strange speculation and insane interpretation is the other side of the truth that belongs to an enlightenment. Today, in times of dramatic order dissolution, the suspicion that many dark forces are hiding behind is an obvious, but also often incorrect explanation. No, neither Jewish financial sharks on the American East Coast nor Russian spies or Chinese Bots are the cause of the dramatic changes that the globalized, crisis-ridden world brings us. This form of Interpretation not only amounts to discriminating images of the enemy, it also distracts from a precise, cold blood analysis of conditions.

The unrestricted exchange of goods, global access to resources, the omnipotent law of exploitation and the mass direct contact of people all over the world are the [sources](http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me02/me02_225.htm "Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England") of overexploitation, social division, environmental destruction and epidemics. Of course, as with everything, concrete individuals and organizations play a role, but without the logical principles that drive them, they could not play that role. It falls short of focusing on individuals and organizations. It's about the principle.

#### The double character, and the Dilemma

Basically, what is called conspiracy theory is an expression of a certain awkwardness of World clarification. And as much as the sometimes abstruse patterns of explanation may come along, they have a useful role as regards the principle, that is, the relations of production and property. They distract from the causes and offer a wonderful opportunity to mock the absurdity of interpreting grievances. Yes, conspiracy theories also have a double character. On the one hand, they are a variant of the audacious Illusion, on the other hand, however, a rebellion against conditions that no longer seem right. As with Religion, as with romance and as with Illusion par excellence.

The absurd part in this game is played by those who concentrate on discrediting the attempt to explain it as such. They see themselves as the owners of a truth that explains nothing. They sell the Status quo as the naturally given, desirable and inevitable, and exclude the need for an analysis that gets to the bottom of the matter. They thus make themselves advocates of a reality that is in decay with its principles of order, and define those who are helpless in the face of the process as meaningless, overwhelmed by complexity.

Yes, it is a Dilemma. Apologetics and absurd theory are diametrically opposed. Neither the one nor the other leads further. Only analysis with a sharp mind and without taboos can help.
