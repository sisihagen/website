[The Walking Dead](http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-walking-dead" "The Walking Dead on AMC") has a good start and showed an interesting alternative to the typical films. In the movies it's in 90 minutes only for the survival of a firearm. Its survival is not only of firearms. At the moment, the series ends again in the typical U.S. / West behavior. One party to the other party wants to impose their own morality and. Said if necessary in a war This goes for many episodes so and I get the feeling that the authors lack ideas, or the producers run out of money. In the last episode of one year has been spoken and the survivors spent in prison and the other in a secured location. The infrastructure is crippled and the supermarkets are cleared safely. What to feed them? Where washing yourself and your clothes? Where the necessary medical items are hergenommen? Many relevant questions remain unanswered. Here, the creators of the series have even managed to convert a racist to a Samaritan. Right now it looks once again made ​​to the old, no enemy can not live on the west.
