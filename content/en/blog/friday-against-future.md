"Black Friday", this year on 29 November, will be exuberant with the previous" Black Week " ushered in and, so to speak, greeted with the red carpet.  Numerous shops offer at this time and especially on this day, i.e. 24 hours, supposedly, unique offers and special discounts. You don't want to miss a Deal? Then you will find here (Link Source 1) even an extra set Countdown for your super bargain-and let's go!

With colourful advertisements, red signs, overloaded banners and flashing arrows, the buyer will be served in the Online stores probably the best Deals of his life as on the silver tablet. You can't say No, Can you? So it's quick to click on " buy " to not miss any offer, because the time availability is limited. Of course, we quickly price our Paypal data and thus initiate the purchase process, to get the desired product soon convenient to us home delivered. One more thing to say: you can't buy happiness …

A wonderful opportunity to educate today's consumer society even more "the-must-have"-thinking and thus to bring the wild pack into excessive consumption. A bargain there, a bargain here — it's really hard to resist. But what do we buy here anyway?

"The money that we don't have, we buy things we don't need, to impress people we like" (quote from the movie "Fight Club").

Apart from the basic question of whether we need these products, and especially in this quantity really, there is also the question of how much we will save in this time and especially on this day, really, and whether it is really so much, as we always suggested.

"A study has just revealed that in the UK, 95 per cent of the products in the six months after Black Friday are as expensive or even cheaper than on the bargain day itself" (2).

And the magazine "Wiso" on ZDF (3) observed a virtual shopping cart with 3,000 products in the course of a price analysis during the Black Friday last year for three months and concluded: on the Black Friday the customer does not tend to save more or less than on an average other day of the Year (4). As a result of the high percentage of products and the time pressure during the purchase, things are consumed, which we can acquire under the year for the same or even for less money.

But this is not so important, because this American Trend is only supposed to be the harbinger for the upcoming holiday season. The calm ... or perhaps more the Tornado before the storm so. The supposedly silent and contemplative time of the year, use the shops for a socially accepted and sometimes wanted a real tabula Rasa-action, to peddle their products in large quantities in order for the people to fulfill their unfulfilled-at-heart gift dreams.

The video " Happiness "(5), in which the mouse people are looking for happiness all their life and above all" to be happy", reflects this attitude to life drastically and completely honestly. People — and I do not want to exclude myself here-choose the way of consumption to get happiness, but may not realize until too late that they are on a wooden path. In the Video, this route allowed the mice to walk into the impenetrable catches of The Mousetrap.

Honestly, who doesn't know? Especially in times when you do not feel as good as usual, you are easier to buy this part — be it a garment or an electronic device or the like. It certainly feels good to own it at this Moment.

Consumption is firmly anchored in our minds and is part of our life like breathing. But unlike breathing, we can reduce consumption. Every small step in consuming a mindfulness is a step into a fulfilling life rather than an over-filled life and, above all, a step away from the wood path.

With a mindful consumer behavior, it gives not only his Inner, more mindfulness, but also the entire world. Through the debates of recent months, so many people have questioned and reflected our destructive behavior, in which each individual is necessarily involved through his or her consumption.

Is it not up to us — to me, to you — to change something in our own sphere of action and perhaps even to take the first step?

How about a "White Friday"?

A Friday when you don't consume anything extra, you don't buy anything new to make it easier for us, rather than our bank account.

A Friday, when you sort out your bulging wardrobe and arrange a clothes exchange or donating the clothes that are no longer needed.

A Friday, when you take your food in the pantry under the microscope and finally consume, instead of standing in the store and not knowing what you actually have at home and, for example, the cream, the apples this week the tenth time in the shopping cart — to be on the safe side.

A Friday, when you invite your loved ones, spend time with them and conduct rich conversations.

And how about giving something really valuable at Christmas? I don't mean material value. How about we give ourselves time? How about we give each other beautiful words? How about we just give ourselves some peace and mindfulness together?

It is about consciously asking ourselves the question that has always been our concern: What do I really need to live a happy life?
