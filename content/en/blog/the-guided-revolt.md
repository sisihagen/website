South of Beirut, near the suburb of Khalde, a man was hit
[deadly](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2019/11/21/Soldier-who-accused-of-killing-Alaa-Abou-Fakher-in-Lebanon-charged-with-murder.html "Soldier accused of killing Alaa Abou Fakher in Lebanon charged with murder")
on Tuesday, when soldiers under the use of firearms tried to expel a
gathering of people after a violent dispute from an important traffic
intersection. The man, whose Name is specified with Alaa Abou Fakher,
was a member of the Progressive Socialist party (PSP), for which he sat
in the city Council of Khalde. The PSP-Chairman Walid Jumblatt [called
on the

"to count on the state", because "the Land will otherwise be thrown into
Chaos". The Army Command began an investigation against the soldier in
question.

President Michel Aoun spoke on Tuesday in an interview with Al Mayadeen
about the protesters \' demands for a technocrat government. "A
government based solely on technocrats cannot determine the country\'s
policy," says Aoun. He wanted to form a government of technocrats and
politicians.

The protesters called on Aoun to release the country after four weeks of
protests: "if they continue to do so, they will destroy Lebanon and its
own interests."One works" day and night to stabilize the situation". On
the question of whether the retired prime minister Saad Hariri would
return to office, Aoun replied that nothing had yet been decided. In the
meantime, the former minister of Finance Mohammad Safadi had been
proposed to take over as prime minister. Only a few days later did
Safadi withdraw its approval. The IMF and the world Bank are already
waiting.

Last weekend, the [World
Bank](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-protests/world-bank-ready-to-support-lebanon-urges-quick-formation-of-new-cabinet-idUSKBN1XG1LK "World Bank ready to support Lebanon, urges quick formation of new cabinet")
had asked Lebanon to call a new cabinet" within a week \" to halt the
further economic crash. Lebanon is heavily indebted, and although the
Lebanese living abroad have billions of US dollars on the Lebanese
banks, they cannot have their money. The banks have for years made
private deposits to the Lebanese central bank to finance government
operations, said the head of the central bank Riyadh Salame in a recent
[CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/28/middleeast/lebanon-salame-economy-collapse-intl/index.html "Lebanon 'days' away from economic collapse if no political solution to protests found, says central bank governor")
Interview. The banks had been promised up to 20 percent interest.

However, neither interest was paid nor the borrowed money was returned.
For weeks the banks have been closed and only occasionally open for a
few hours. Holders of US Dollar accounts will not have access to their
money, in the banks it is said to have occurred in part grievances
between the account holders and the bank staff. ATMs spending US dollars
and Lebanese currency until early October provide only Lebanese pounds
(LBP). The national currency, which since the end of the Civil War 1990
is bound at 1.500 per 1 US Dollar, has lost value. On the black market,
one US Dollar now costs up to 2000 LBP.

Prices for food have risen by up to 20 percent, even private electricity
and water suppliers demand more. How hard it is, foreign workers who
work in Hotels and private households and their monthly salary in US
dollars. Most of the money is transferred to the Workers \' countries of
origin, where they support their families. Employers have no access to
their US dollar assets and are in arrears with payment. The rise in the
cost of living means that workers demand more to compensate for the rise
in prices.

#### New loans only in case of sale of silverware

On Tuesday, President Aoun met with representatives of the international
support group representing the United Nations, China, France, Germany,
Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the
European Union and the Arab League.

Western States, as well as the International monetary Fund and the world
Bank, [demand from the Lebanon
sale](/static/downloads/1LBNEA2019001.pdf " INFORMATIONAL ANNEX AND STATEMENT BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR LEBANON")
state table silver, such as, for example, the lucrative mobile phone or
the electricity sector. In order to obtain loans promised at the donors
\' conference in Paris 2018 (CEDAR), privatisation is to be pushed
forward.

Investors are also eager for the oil and gas sector, whose Exploration
in the eastern Mediterranean has not yet begun due to border disputes
with Israel.

Aid remains largely absent from the Arab Gulf states, which have
invested billions in Lebanon since the end of the Civil War. Only the
Qatar golf Council paid \$ 500 million to the government in June. The
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has pledged new investments but has not yet
transferred anything. Saudi Arabia, which has invested billions of US
dollars in support of Saad Hariri in Lebanon, is also holding back its
money. This is due to the growing influence of Lebanese Hezbollah, which
emerged as the winner with an alliance from the elections in May 2018.
In the government, which is only a transitional government two weeks ago
after the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the Hezbollah
alliance is represented with four ministers.

In the meantime, the uprising of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese in
mid-October, which was originally triggered by economic concerns, is
being carried out by forces that want to bring down not only the
government but also the parliament.

Various parties, including the Lebanese forces, mobilize their
supporters on to the streets and reject every offer. The Alliance for
Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement, which also includes President
Michel Aoun, call for dialogue and urge the protesters to release the
streets. In mid-October, the Communist Party of Lebanon (KP), which
cooperates closely with Hezbollah, especially in the south of the
country, had partially led the protests at the beginning. A KP
interlocutor, who did not want to be named, acknowledged that other
forces are now trying to control the protests. The situation is unclear
and dangerous.

Similarly, Sofia Saadeh, professor emeritus of the new history of the
Middle East in Beirut, describes the Situation. At first it was about
fair wages, electricity, water, health care, people protested against
corruption. Now the slogans were similar to those known from Syria:
"they want the overthrow of the regime, but in Lebanon there is no
Regime like in Syria."Not only the government, also the president and
especially the Parliament should go, Saadeh describes the demands of the
protesters. "The government and the president have invited to dialogue,
proposed reforms, and the Parliament should discuss them. But people
don\'t want to talk to anyone. What do you want?"

It was firmly convinced that the legitimate criticism of the population
of the many maladministration would be used to overthrow the government
that belonged to Hezbollah. The Parliament was finally elected just a
year and a half, but the US had rejected the result due to the strong
performance of Hezbollah and its Alliance from the beginning.

The reason for the conflict is the poor economic situation, which has
intensified with the US sanctions against Hezbollah.

#### Hezbollah calls for trade with the East

Hezbollah President Hassan Nasrallah strongly criticized the US\'s
economic and financial pressure against Lebanon on Monday. The United
States prevented the flow of capital to the Cedar state, including
Chinese investments. Lebanon will be threatened because it is trading
with its natural neighbours Syria, Iraq or Iran. According to Nasrallah,
the pressure is so great that Lebanese firms are now afraid to invest in
Syria. The country had to free itself from it and to build its own
agriculture and industry. Chinese investments for this were promised
that this would be in the national interest.

"The market in Iraq is a historic opportunity for Lebanon," said
Nasrallah further. The ongoing dispute over the sea border with Israel
along the oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean prevented
Lebanon from promoting its oil and Gas.

According to Nasrallah, criminal investigations against politicians and
officials for possible corruption are supported. "If there is a case
that has to do with a representative of Hezbollah, I urge you to start
with us. I guarantee you the respect of Hezbollah."
