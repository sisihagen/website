Switzerland is regarded as a neutral country. This obligation of neutrality does not appear to apply to banks such as Crédit Suisse. They persistently strike on the side of big money. Whether you invest in chocolate, paper clips or weapons of mass destruction, that makes the financial jugglers not sick. Now Crédit Suisse was talking about itself through a strange incident. She had a former employee shadowed by a detective agency. What was so dangerous about that man?

The head of Crédit Suisse, CEO Tidjane Thiam (57) does not want to have known that his former Top man Iqbal Khan (43) has been shadowed by a detective agency. The cartoonist Patrick Chappatte commented on Crédit Suisse's surveillance in "Le Temps Suisse" ironically: "the good news: they were not pursued by the American tax authorities."

The two top bank managers of Crédit Suisse, who are staying side by side in a Villa on the Gold Coast on Lake Zurich, had previously quarreled arg. The Starbanker Iqbal Khan recently quit his job at Crédit Suisse and was hired by bank UBS. After his departure, he was supervised by detectives on behalf of Crédit Suisse, because they feared that he would recruit top men from his former employer.

Iqbal Khan noticed that he was shadowed when he drove to Shopping with his wife. He tried to shake off his pursuers. But that did not happen. At the Restaurant Metropol in Zurich, Kahn got out and photographed the number plate of the car that followed him. His three pursuers then tried in vain to snatch his cell phone from him. It is tragic that a man who had sent the organization of this surveillance Operation to the detective agency took his life. I find this suicide incomprehensible.

#### The "everyday" business of Swiss banks

With all the Details that the media now document as a monitoring debacle at Crédit Suisse, "everyday" business of the big banks is forgotten, Business that does not make headlines. For example, the investments made by Crédit Suisse, UBS and the Swiss National Bank in companies involved in the production of nuclear bombs. These investments were documented by the ICAN organization, the International Campaign for nuclear disarmament. In 2017, ICAN received the Nobel Peace Prize for its worldwide disarmament efforts.

#### Swiss banks invest $ 8.984 billion in the nuclear weapons division

UBS, the Swiss National Bank and Crédit Suisse are boosting the nuclear arms race with their investments in companies involved in the production of [nuclear bombs](/static/downloads/2019_HOS_web.pdf "Financing the companies that make nuclear weapons"). With their short-sighted investment policy, they also jeopardize our security. In the nuclear weapons report of the [ICAN](https://www.icanswitzerland.ch/schweizer-banken-finanzieren-massenvernichtung-ein-untragbares-sicherheitsrisiko/ "Schweizer Banken finanzieren Massenvernichtung – ein untragbares Sicherheitsrisiko") Swiss financial institutions UBS, as evidenced in previous years, the top spot with investments worth of 6,316 billion US dollars, followed by the Swiss national Bank (1,314 billion dollars), Crédit Suisse (1,313 billion dollars) and Fisch Asset Management ($41 million). All covered Swiss banks together invested $ 8,984 billion in the nuclear weapons division. Compared to ICAN's previous report, the value of Swiss investment has increased by 87 percent.

#### Let's ban nuclear weapons ... because misfortunes happen.

Global nuclear disarmament would be absolutely necessary. After all, in the last 60 years in the last few minutes, the world has been torn by a nuclear strike by the great powers. The Explosion of 100 atomic bombs would cause a nuclear Winter, followed by famine.

#### Investments in firms producing conventional war material

The Crédit Suisse, UBS, Swiss national Bank, such as insurance companies and pension funds in Switzerland, the pension Fund of the city of Zurich, to invest also in companies, the conventional war material such as tanks, Jets, cannons, bombs, and grenades. The need for such war material has been great since the terrible wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Mali, Libya, Syria and so on began after the 9/11 False Flag Operation, wars that made dozens of millions of people refugees. Banks, of course, also help finance exports of war material.

#### What has been done politically in Switzerland, against the financing of nuclear weapons production by Swiss financial institutions?

National Council [Balthasar Glättli](https://www.parlament.ch/DE/ratsbetrieb/suche-curia-vista/geschaeft?AffairId=20173764 "Ist der Bundesrat bereit, Investitionen in Atomwaffen bei Pensionskassenanlagen im eigenen Einflussbereich zu verhindern oder allgemein gesetzlich zu verbieten?"):

> Is the Federal Council prepared to prevent investments in nuclear weapons in pension fund investments in its own sphere of influence or to ban them generally by law? (....) Is the Confederation prepared, within the scope of its powers, to seek to exclude all nuclear weapons producers from the investment universes of pension funds whose investment guidelines it has (co) influence?

The Swiss Federal Council:

> The pension funds have to fulfil their mandate to provide pension benefits and to seek a market-compliant return on their assets within the framework of the applicable regulations. The Confederation has no direct influence. The employer representatives elected by the Federal Council to the Publica cash commission shall vote in principle without instruction. Even with the other institutions mentioned above, investment in assets is not a function of the Federal Council.

Today, pension funds are allowed to invest in nuclear weapons, provided that the country concerned is one of the countries defined as [nuclear weapons states](https://kriegsgeschaefte.ch/der-initiativtext/ "Art. 107a Verbot der Finanzierung von Kriegsmaterialproduzenten"), such as the USA, Great Britain, Russia, France and China, although this is a far-reaching Interpretation of the war material law by the Federal Council.

In fact, according to the federal law on [war material](https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19960753/index.html "Bundesgesetz über das Kriegsmaterial") "direct financing of the development, production or acquisition of prohibited war material is prohibited". These are "nuclear weapons, biological or chemical weapons (ABC weapons)" the law does not mention the fact that it is allowed to finance companies in recognized nuclear-weapon states that are involved in the production of nuclear explosive devices.

The [war business Initiative](https://www.gsoa.ch/press_release/kriegsgeschaefte-initiative-offiziell-zustande-gekommen/ "Kriegsgeschäfte-Initiative offiziell zustande gekommen") officially came about on 20 July 2018 with 104,612 validly certified signatures.  The Initiative requires that any kind of financing of war material producers by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and institutions of state and occupational provision be prohibited. "No one wants to accept that our money is used to produce war material that is used to kill people in too many places," said Judith Schmid, secretary of the group for a Switzerland without army (GsoA).

As could be expected, the Federal Council, the seven-member Swiss government, rejected the [war business Initiative](https://www.gsoa.ch/press_release/mutloser-bundesrat-verkennt-wille-der-bevoelkerung/ "Mutloser Bundesrat verkennt Wille der Bevölkerung") without counter-proposal. As the group for a Switzerland without an army (GsoA) stated, the Federal Council does not only ignore the need to rethink financial assets, but also the clear unwillingness of the population that their pension fund funds will flow into deadly industries.

After the treatment of the war business Initiative by the federal councils, by the National Council and Council of states, the date of the referendum is then fixed.
