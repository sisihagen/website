The president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, has declared his resignation at the pressure of the Bolivian military. By criticizing these events, Morales is not automatically protected: even possible justified criticism of the president or political errors committed by him does not justify the upheaval experienced. Accordingly, there are numerous international voices, which now clearly call the process in Bolivia a coup. These votes include several Latin American heads of State. The British opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, condemned the "coup against the Bolivian people". The head of the Left Party Sahra Wagenknecht, finds clear words:

> The coup d'état in Bolivia is an attack on democracy, social justice and independence in Latin America. All social achievements and the cultural rights of the indigenous people created under the presidency of Evo Morales are at stake now.

In addition to respect for the "decision of Evo Morales to resign in the face of the military coup", Wagenknecht also expresses incomprehension about the German government's silence about the coup. But the opposite is the case, as "RT" currently reports from the federal press conference. The government's spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, stated that he welcomed the resignation of the Bolivian President, "as an important step” – forced by the military. The name of the operation as a "coup”, however, is "an interesting rating of RT". How did you call the same attempted action in Turkey? Oh, Putsch! What would Troll Seibert call it would the Bundeswehr Angela "rubber woman" Merkel drop? 

#### Media degradation of the overthrow relieves federal government

This government's stance can only be sustained because most of the major media refuse to call the coup in Bolivia this: this coup is not supposed to be a coup. This distortion by many media unduly reduces the pressure on the federal government to condemn the anti-democratic processes in Bolivia. In this respect, Seibert is indeed right: there is hardly a German-speaking Medium that "evaluates" the overthrow on the pressure of the military as "RT". But exceptions confirm here too the rule, which clearly designate the overthrow, are first to call the " Young World "negative once again the peace Springer Pseudo-left newspaper" taz " stands out.

But first of all to the big media. Many of these publications choose a similar path: therefore, Morales has initially submitted his resignation as normal due to protests. The overthrow of the military under pressure, through this formulation, becomes a dubious statement from the mouth of a stubborn old head of State, who does not want to clear his chair, although "the people" want changes. So the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" writes: "President Morales resigns and speaks of 'coup'."The "level" increases, and writes: "Bolivia's President Morales, rails against 'coup'."And also the" FAZ", the" Deutschlandfunk "or" T-Online " choose among numerous other media the nebulous formulation of the processes that Morales calls a coup.

#### A overthrow as a Fanal for the " democratization of Latin America"

The "world", which indirectly classifies the coup into a "democratization of Latin America", goes even further.

> Now his allies, the socialist dictators in Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba, tremble. The Opposition hopes for democratisation throughout Latin America.

On the positive side, the "world" also refers once again to the at least questionable opposition leader in Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, who has swayed that in Latin America a "Democratic hurricane" can be felt. To be defamed on the other hand, the expressions of solidarity of prominent Latin American politicians: Brazil Ex-President Lula Da Silva, Argentina's future President, Alberto Fernández, Mexico's incumbent, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, as well as the "socialist dictators" Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela and Miguel Díaz-Canel of Cuba would "all of a coup against Morales,” to speak. However, they are not credible because "a legend of the coup" would pass them.

The" Süddeutsche Zeitung "goes on and wants to reassure the responsibility for the overthrow of Morales himself: "Morales has to blame its end itself". The Medium explains the events in Bolivia to a normal democratic will formation where one wonders who is probably the new president here is used by the west to let the country bleed out.

> But in the end, Morales has to blame himself. If he had been assigned in time or had built up a successor in his own ranks with good electoral chances, he could have retired in honor without the people's anger boiling. That's how democratic politics works.

#### "Personal cult": Morales is "himself to blame"

The accusation of provoking one's fall through personal cult and obsession with power, and thereby justifying it, is indirectly directed by The "taz" against Morales. In the face of the destinies of Morales and Lula Da Silva, dubious title "dispensable men" writes The "taz": "Ex-president Lula in Brazil and Evo Morales in Bolivia show how different their Situation is, what is the danger in the cult of persons."The talk of the coup is therefore "transparent Propaganda" despite admonition examples:

> A coup d'état orchestrated by the right was in progress, he warned and appealed to the solidarity of all the left. That was transparent Propaganda. Only: experiences such as the Brazilian, where a corrupt right the PT President Dilma Rousseff has dropped and let Lula put in jail, reinforce such discourses.

The bird is shot by The "taz" but with a report from the streets of Bolivia after the fall, the Kitsch, naivety and Agitation mixed in a barely tolerable way:

> In the midst of the red-yellow-green crowd, Juan Carlos Zamora (31) and Vanesa Gallardo (31) kiss closely encircled. 'We are so happy about democracy,' he says. 'My wife and I will be able to start a family and raise our children in a free country! Vanesa's pregnant.

In addition to such anti-enlightening romanticism, the article also spreads hard opinion matter, the violence went from the government camp and a return Morales stands " to fear":

> In fact, until Saturday, the violence had almost exclusively originated from his own supporters, who had started with rods, sticks, stones and explosive devices on the demonstrators. ( ... ) President Evo Morales still has to declare his resignation in writing in order to become official. Some fear that he will return.

#### Militancy: evil in Bolivia-good in Chile?

In another article, The "taz" refers to the coup as a "legend" and explains Morales’ political demise by the fact that he had "simply deluded with his own claim to power". But the article also raises an interesting and important question for the further and fundamental assessment of militancy:

> Would it be for those who complain of a coup d'état, even one, if the Chilean Carabineros would stop shooting the protesters, solidarity with their demands and demand the resignation of Piñera? Will not happen. But if so, it would be celebrated as a victory of the people and democracy.
